I'm pretty stressed out. It's manageable, it always is, kinda. Managability makes sense,
though whether something is manageable makes less sense. I've been reading Anti-Oedipus
and I'll be able to make connections between it and managability through some kind of
weird desiring-machine (or whatever the fuck. I'm only on chapter 2 and I'm reading
slow, be nice). The capital machine produces working-stress machine produces
overwhelming-amy machines produces amy-willpower. (not very good at this (u cud say a
minor-product of these machines is brainfuzz-stupid.bitch.energy machines))

Interview grind is gay. Techies suffer for it (not a bad thing).

I'm tired. I'm so tired. Those desires to just be taken care of by a tech tran who can
keep me safe is a trap. Never ever fall for this. More will to power is needed and those
desires reduce productivity of will-powers. Comfort produced by the weight of the eyes -
ecstasy in the soreness of the spine - love-drunk happiness when fingers stiff and
concentration is short.

Readdress yourself. Edit the brain.

I'm so tired.

I want to write more on the "Bad people" thing,I spoke with a close friend Izz about it
and I think there's a lot to it. Off the top of my head, I don't think people are just
"rapists", its more just that they have "rapey" behaviors that can fly under the radar
most the time but once in a blue moon, when everything lines up, that "rapey" behavior
causes a lot of harm to someone. I was thinking this when thinking about a few times
when I was going to interact with someone I didn't know very well and a close friend
would tell me that they did terrible terrible things. When I actually end up hanging out
with them, nothing bad happens, or alternatively when talking to them about the
situation their reality is incredibly different.

I'll probably get to writing more about it so I can organize my thoughts better.
