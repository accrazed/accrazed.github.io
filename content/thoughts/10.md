i got a bunch of notes out at least here, i think i want to write an outline on my laptop and start a list of citations and quotes that will help me focus when I start writing more explicitly later

my goal will be to convince myself and other people to affirm and empower themselves in the face of complacency bugs and doomed feelings of transcendentally fuelled alterity

alterity is a problem for the transcendental idealists

doesnt need to be a problem

finished reading the chapter on mahayana Buddhism and deleuze as they both relate to transcendence, immanence, and affirmation of difference

and i think i can tie that into the webs of conflicting thoughts i have, intensities in every ontological state that expresses itself becoming, affirmation of those states and a general ethics towards an intensification of those states

i think i just need to trace this better with otherness, there was a particular bump here


i get peeved at how loosely """"original""" nature"  gets used becuase there's certainly not a regression to it, and additionally how loose "Oneness without the other" can be interpreted to trace cultish bodies and general domination if levied dismissively

the life oriented nature of it all is also a bit curious, unlife is cuter and doesn't hold as many little bugs that stray to certain disintensifications

the dismissiveness is important, it proliferates complacent circuits. I can see why fisher was so frustrated with this

there feels like an exclusive-overlapping between the state of intensity-disintensity, and frustration-complacency. I think to some extent intensity exists even in complacent bodies, the intensity comes in seeing it to its n-th power

This totally gets into accelerationist fragmentation, and the ways in which different flavors of acc in effect create channels that intensify certain circuits. "You get the acc that you deserve"

but most of those channelings end up effecting the world in meaningless ways

this channeling I think is tugging me towards maoist teachings too, I always hear about how maoist philosophy is about widening these channels and maybe work off practical ways to engage in that which drive into phenomenological (colonial) ends

domination. world domination.

war machines. we need war machines. I need to read about war machines next

nonono, i need to read about them first before deciding how to take its guts

and there is little that stops this intensification of so many bodies from channeling into a practice of murder

its like a sand blaster, sprays in an area that exists as a spread of probabilities, but I bet those probabilities get stretched out temporally

time travel

lightly curious about Reza Negasterani's Intelligence and Spirit


FULL OF PARTICLES GENERATE ALL THE PARTICLES

incest maxxing

writing about these things reinforces the channels

need bodies to bounce off of to channel, the channels expose more lines of flight

lack of specificity / desert bodies allow for a good amount of wandering but is primally repressed

early onset alzheimers

beating the microplastics with intensified function, child labor. nonono, child passions, and a child's desires in the face of inhumanity 

hegemonic/complacent society that yearns the child for a normal life, we are all children

mentioning the internal feelings and desires to fit in or hatred of body as as means to pull bodies into sad passions / joyful passions, and that helps create a more effective entrypoint into the pipeline that i want to pull them into

no, i want to channel unconditional  love

and i think that state that rest alongside world domination

that's what holds my thoughts so softly

what points me so endearingly towards those I affirm with
