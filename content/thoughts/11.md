I'm using the word "metacognition" to get at what i'm trying to talk about, but take your words with salt, please. the sequence of thoughts that sparked my thought about metacognition was:

A::(

  "the chicken rice i made yesterday was alright, but i bet i could have made it better",

  "i wonder if the chicken was still a little frozen in the core, which was why they tasted a little chewy, though we're safe cuz we did measure it to 165",

  "hm, i could totally call out of work today over like food poisoning??? like i bet it sucks to get salmonella",

  "NO, i gotta get into the habit of working consistently, takes 3 months to enshrine a habit",

  "hmm it would help if i got in the habit of not thinking so much about excuses, i bet if i got myself to think solely about getting up for work that it would end up better for me",

  "hm, i could say this about metacognizing generally, i wonder how one would trim their thoughtscape for the purpose of preventing themselves in a state where they debilitate themselves over the habit of overthinking",

  "hm, this is just like when Quanxi talks about ignorance being bliss, though i think it's less about ignorance and more about mindfulness about thoughts",

  "hm, i can totally chart this on a body without organs too"
