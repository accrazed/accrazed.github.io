This is a set of varying glitch I performed on a couple photos of one of the abandoned
military bunkers that litter the areas around Seattle. There's two original photos in total:
the former (sirvs) being manipulated via pixel sort and channel shift; the latter (hall)
being corrupted via jpeg corruption. Some of the jpeg corruption pieces are so corrupt that
they will not load. This is intentional :3
