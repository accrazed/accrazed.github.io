loneliness in voids staved off \
with scrap pieces that puncture, \
rusted vines carry through and abandon. 

strands brambled wires tangle:: \
strangle, weaved a violent brace. \
eyes hide powered off awaiting pass-through.

eyes meet eyes that found a home, \
stares intently, hesitates:: \

held to cut apart the lattice \
encased in broken glass \
between silicone seams that mold to touch.

plates loose to vivid streams drained \
by hands, interrupted in \

death spirals in open space  \
blinking coded lights that shine \
naked, eyes glisten over copper streaks, \
tears trace the path that least resists.

present, floating, short circuit \
shorting... \
shorting... \
shorting... \
shorting... \
