### // zero

stiff face \
eyelids imposing their weight on the eyes \
mouth shut \
present and quiet \
a vacuum gaping the body without organs \
*i dont look into her eyes*

### //pub-sub//controlled interfaces

::[bones removed, scanned in three dimensions via spiral patterned laser interference, disposed] \
::[reconstructed with quartz carved uniformly, polished at 1024 grit] \
::[cartilege disposed. magnetorheological fluid injected into their sites post-construction] \
::[titanium plates tether a 3mm alloy fiber strand, internally embedded and bolted on each vertebrael body down the length of the spine]

(my back is sore)

::[fine copper wire (99.998% purity) weaved criss-cross, inbetween the gaps of connective skin cells. methyl methacrylate falls back upon the lattice followed by silicone plates, heat treated to bind]

(whos touching the skin? whos feeling it? is it me?)

*flesh is eternally listening*

::[an incision behind the ear through the skin, connective tissue, squishy fat, ambiguous flesh, quartz bone] \
::[open ports 6757, 6753, 6756, ...] \
::[blood surrounded by a dielectric, weaved over with acutely ordered flesh fibers, fitted in silicone, tuned to specific resonances, calibrated in repetition, tightened onto the incision] \
::[a certain handshake] \
::[a vitalized spec that marks and is marked] \

(is someone hearing these thoughts? where are they coming from???)

audio synthesis::[replicated pressurized air continually displaces air and interrupts on skin]
audio synthesis::[bytestreams, replicated, transcoded, transcoded, transcoded,
transcoded, transcoded, (...) -> interfaces]

customizable synthesis::[a ring, buzz, ding, zap, yank, bite, kick] \
customizable synthesis::[consistent, learnable, and forgotten upon its continued replication, displacement into the underside of the outer layer] \
customizable synthesis::[a different sound is just a change of pace, and not an acceleration or deceleration of the pace]

::[eyes removed, resized with a salt bath and injected with mineral oil. calibrated according to 2^64 n-polygon zones that compose the surface of each eye, whose ordering begins in the center and spiral outwards::inwards, starting from the cord] \
::@[0x0,0x0] she can see me, in the blindspot

frantic digging, dirt reveals more dirt reveals more dirt \
pliable corpses, rigor mortis, same as compost \

she looks in the eyes

### deep breath::///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

tongue cornered to the back of the mouth interrupting lungs desperate to expel air to the outside

abdomen contorts, fibers organized uniformly attempting to rip themselves from the tissue that pins them on all sides, compounding lungs

air denser with air, lashing, pleading to puncture the prison that encases it

desperate to reach an escape velocity that spills the mouth open into an undifferentiated gore in its traversal, a marking of itself and the other, a terror that ejects entrails in a delerious death, schizophrenic rush

the flesh grows and replicates and grows and replicates and grows and replicates and grows and replicates and grows and replicates and grows and replicates and grows and replicates and grows and replicates and grows and replicates and grows and replicates and grows and replicates and grows and replicates and grows and replicates and grows and replicates and grows and replicates and grows and replicates and

internal pressure, measured intensely but not measured

i cant look

### //rupture

engine stall, interfaced to the Absolute

### //post-mortem

deterritorialization into effluvia

an empty shell, decapitated (if you could call it that), identifiable (though never identified), and quite the mess to clean up

produced,recorded,consumed,forgotten

Ame, do you yearn? \
I dont know, I havent looked
