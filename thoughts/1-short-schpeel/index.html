      <p>I'm pretty stressed out. It's manageable, it always is, kinda. Managability makes sense,
though whether something is manageable makes less sense. I've been reading Anti-Oedipus
and I'll be able to make connections between it and managability through some kind of
weird desiring-machine (or whatever the fuck. I'm only on chapter 2 and I'm reading
slow, be nice). The capital machine produces working-stress machine produces
overwhelming-amy machines produces amy-willpower. (not very good at this (u cud say a
minor-product of these machines is brainfuzz-stupid.bitch.energy machines))</p>
<p>Interview grind is gay. Techies suffer for it (not a bad thing).</p>
<p>I'm tired. I'm so tired. Those desires to just be taken care of by a tech tran who can
keep me safe is a trap. Never ever fall for this. More will to power is needed and those
desires reduce productivity of will-powers. Comfort produced by the weight of the eyes -
ecstasy in the soreness of the spine - love-drunk happiness when fingers stiff and
concentration is short.</p>
<p>Readdress yourself. Edit the brain.</p>
<p>I'm so tired.</p>
<p>I want to write more on the "Bad people" thing,I spoke with a close friend Izz about it
and I think there's a lot to it. Off the top of my head, I don't think people are just
"rapists", its more just that they have "rapey" behaviors that can fly under the radar
most the time but once in a blue moon, when everything lines up, that "rapey" behavior
causes a lot of harm to someone. I was thinking this when thinking about a few times
when I was going to interact with someone I didn't know very well and a close friend
would tell me that they did terrible terrible things. When I actually end up hanging out
with them, nothing bad happens, or alternatively when talking to them about the
situation their reality is incredibly different.</p>
<p>I'll probably get to writing more about it so I can organize my thoughts better.</p>
