internal bleeding, numbness invading - inhale: <br />
rabbit needs her home. <br />
reality soon checks, as they've always been being. <br />
warmth spreads, breathing stops but it's different this time. <br />
crying, longing, but even death doesn't part. <br />
it ends - the stopped breathing stops - exhale. \</p>
<p>buns <br />
She'll never forget what happened, and bless her for that. <br />
She was there while I found myself, and was always with soul. <br />
The habit to think of my value to her rationally, <br />
though that mind type serves no good function. <br />
We existed, we laughed, and got to live out happy thoughts. <br />
Reality ever changes and the future doesn't really need to be exact, <br />
just with you.</p>
