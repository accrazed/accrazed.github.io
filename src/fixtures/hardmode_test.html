<div>incessant, but turbulent. </div>
<div>soft, yet unrelenting grasp. </div>
<br/>
<div>it scribes no tune, prying soul without aesthetic </div>
<div>and deterritorializes the rabbit, </div>
<div>rendering her so meaningfully meaningless. </div>
<br/>
<div>the rabbit shit everywhere while she was maimed </div>
<div>and she never could run any anyways. </div>
<br/>
<div>she longs for futures but only has paws. </div>
<br/>
<div>gestalt externally rererearranged. </div>
<div>her interface is corrupted - no, foreign. </div>
<div>modified, now ununrecognizable. </div>
<br/>
<div>and was it always prying? </div>
<div>and was it ever hungry? </div>
<div>it's no longer part of her. </div>
