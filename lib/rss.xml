 <br><br>The schizophrenic can sometimes experience intensive quantities in their pure state (from the <a data-href="Celibate Machine" href="\2.-the-body-without-organs\celibate-machine.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Celibate Machine</a>).<br>
There is a schizophrenic experience of intensive quantities in their pure state, to a point that is almost unbearable -- a celibate misery and glory experienced to the fullest, like a cry suspended between life and death, an intense feeling of transition states of pure, naked intensity stripped of all shape and form.

AO18::2

<br>These intense quantities are first and foremost experienced as a primary [emotion::feeling], which is then followed by [delirium::"I think"] and [hallucination::"I hear"::"I see"]. This [emotion::feeling] internalizes [delirium::"I think"] and externalizes [hallucination::"I hear"::"I see"]]]></description><link>1.-desiring-production\the-schizophrenic.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">1.

 <br>%Excerpt By random guy Bo Roth%<br><br><br><br>In 1919, the German psychiatrist and art historian Hans Prinzhorn introduced painting as a therapy among his patients at Heidelberg University Hospital, thus setting the precedent that would lead to what Jean Dubuffet in 1945 called - Art Brut.<br>
Fascinated by the power and truth contained in the works of these beings separated from society.<br>Dubuffet dedicated himself to collecting and exhibiting them for the rest of his life, bequeathing a significant number of works to the Collection de l'Art Brut (Ville de Lausanne).<br>Among these artists were mentally ill, but also prisoners, children, self-taught.<br>
Robert Gie was a carpenter before he was hospitalized in a psychiatric institution at Rosegg from 1908 to 1922 due to hallucinatory disorders.<br>From 1916 on, becoming increasingly reclusive, he devoted himself feverishly to drawing on walls or on bits of paper he manages to salvage.<br>His drawings are characterized by complex networks of cables that penetrate the figures, crossing through them and extending into others – an imaginary "influencing machine" that he believed controlled their movements.<br>Gie’s figures are surrounded by waves and currents, which are often depicted penetrating the sensitive areas of their feet, palms and palates.<br>Gie often wore a handkerchief over his face to prevent these emanations from entering him while he worked.<br>These drawings are reminiscent of electroshock treatments used as therapy in psychiatric centers.<br>The human nervous system becomes part of wider networks of interconnections, being subsumed into a mechanical whole by the general set of production.<br>
All the characters are connected by these flows, which in turn connect to others in endless extensions.<br>The organism is subject to the only organization given it by its desirable nature; it cannot leave it. Each organ is a machine that channels its flow to another machine that enters into a process where the only thing produced is production itself: schizo-nature.<br><br><img alt="Robert_Gie_1.png" src="\lib\media\robert_gie_1.png"><br>
