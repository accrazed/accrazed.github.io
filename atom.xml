reality soon checks, as they&#x27;ve always been being. &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

crying, longing, but even death doesn&#x27;t part. &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
it ends - the stopped breathing stops - exhale. \&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

She&#x27;ll never forget what happened, and bless her for that. &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
She was there while I found myself, and was always with soul. &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
The habit to think of my value to her rationally, &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
though that mind type serves no good function. &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
We existed, we laughed, and got to live out happy thoughts. &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
Reality ever changes and the future doesn&#x27;t really need to be exact, &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Knowing must therefore be accompanied by an equal capacity to forget knowing. Non-knowing is
not a for of ignorance but a difficult transcendence of knowledge. This is the price that must
be paid for a oeuvre to be, at all times, a sort of pure beginning, which makes its creation an
exercise in freedom.&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bachelard, quoting Jean Lescure (I haven&#x27;t read these fags :p)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A::[Ugh. Knowing, not knowing, thinking, not thinking, overthinking, not thinking enough.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A::[I have a lot of trouble talking to people, and I think an issue with it is that I&#x27;m trying to overanalyze the process involved in conversation. Part of that is in wanting to get (::[&quot;yearning for&quot;]?) a high-resolution map of this process so I can poke at many aspects of it and see if something is loose, if I can find something that will help me in talking to people, or at the very minimum cross out all the potential avenues and find myself stuck again.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;C::[You&#x27;re intellectualizing, Ames. There&#x27;s more going on. You&#x27;re down reeeeal bad for this girl thing.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z::[&quot;But the outside is transcendentally, not empirically, exterior: it&#x27;s already inside you - there is no inside, that&#x27;s the Horror...&quot;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affirm (◕ᴗ◕✿)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A-&amp;gt;B::[Anyways, lets overanalyze this. I&#x27;m gonna try thinking in a few different ways, like it or don&#x27;t.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B::[There&#x27;s many things to consider, and equally important is the method of analyzing these things. I&#x27;d like to build out angles in communication that I can perceive, lay each of them out with several differentials to consider &lt;em&gt;not as concepts but as data&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and then use all these deltas to constitute an Idea of what I mean. All of these differentials will be marked D.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D::[Time. In verbal communication, usually some time is designated for one person to speak, and then the other person responds: it&#x27;s rather synchronous, and sequential. Over the wire, parties can communicate their thoughts at the same time, and then asynchronously read the messages of others (albeit still sequential, but multiplied). In flesh, events &quot;fade&quot; as memories, though maintain a habitual change in us. The wires usually maintain a much more discrete log of the events transpired. The world demands our time, demands it to be allocated, and asynchronous spaces accommodate to that.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;C::[What&#x27;s going on in that time? I look at the clock and hours have passed, have I really been talking to it so long? I get the urge to comm again, has it only been 15 minutes since the last message? It lingers under my skin, I can cope about the time spent to dismiss the feelings, but it&#x27;s inside me. Even when we&#x27;re not talking, some time gets being spent thinking about it, a one-sided conversation. I&#x27;ll retrace the conversations again. Time passes without a feeling of being seen, and I feel fine about it, and I feel worried about it. These events all fold into my flesh, and I&#x27;m experiencing it all at once. When its all folded in, the sequence is of secondary importance to what has, is, and will transpire, but I&#x27;ll only ever continue to experience sequentially.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z::[A vibro-knife plunged into the sternum, still. The only thing moving is time, the wound is intensively felt, and a phantasmic trace of events mark its continual propogation. A still slicing, a temporal scarring.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affirm (◕ᴗ◕✿)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D::[Space. Through what medium does the communication travel? Verbal communication uses sounds, and can include onomatopoeia, as well as variation in pitches and tones of voice that embed with it social cues. Typing is primarily bound to the wire, engages in the form of writing, and can include the use of emoticons, images&#x2F;memes, links to virtual spaces. Typing can also include metadata (like tone tags) to help accentuate the messages themselves, but they all amount to parts, all added to the database of possible configurations and assemblies.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;C::[Where the fuck do I start and end? I write or type or giggle, and it takes up space—shared space. A presence, flesh::wire::otherwise, demands it be seen, demands it exist, demands it violate all that perceives it, and is violated in turn. There are intensities: I ramble in 10000 LOC and out 100000 gasps, taps, bites, lines, words, sounds, thoughts, &lt;em&gt;things&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Signifying chains are exchanged, codes intertwined, mixed up, the words &quot;I&quot; tell her grace &quot;my&quot; own body, but a body disassembled, a girlfriend-without-organs.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z::[&quot;I want to have my throat slashed while violating the girl to whom I will have been able to say: you are the night. \ The Sun exclusively loves the Night and directs its luminous violence, its ignoble shaft, toward the earth, but finds itself incapable of reaching the gaze or the night, even though the nocturnal terrestrial expanses head continuously toward the indecency of the solar ray. \ The solar annulus is the intact anus of her body at eighteen years to which nothing sufficiently blinding can be compared except the sun, even though the anus is night.&quot; - Bataille, &lt;em&gt;The Solar Anus&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affirm (◕ᴗ◕✿)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D::[Congruence. Congruence requires two objects to compare against. Does communication hold congruencies? Seemingly depends. What if one person is talking, and the other typing? One venting and the other holding? One speaking, the other listening? One in Spanish, another Russian? Is it ever &quot;congruent&quot;? Nietzsche long since desecrated the notion of clear communication, these processes transmogrify out the senses, out mouths, through sounds assigned words, into ears or eyes or noses or skin (or...), and into other senses. The congruence in this feels like a molar sense of reciprocation—that is, you can view communication very symmetrically at a holistic level (e.g. &quot;Speaking English, saying hello, following a certain manner generally&quot;) but upon tuning the dial finer and finer you find many idiosyncracies that calve symmetry into fragmentated, incongruable difference.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;C::[Stunning, fucking stunning. Sometimes I can&#x27;t even form a coherent thought. Her words pass through a body that orients itself around everything it passes, but its Her in particular which ends up carving a space out on the body. I accept it, it passes through me with little blockage, and other coordinates begin to align. This &lt;em&gt;can&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; be grooming, this &lt;em&gt;can&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; be manipulative, but its &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;surely&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; a maddening mirror that reflects outo the backside as well as the front. It leaves as it comes back again, an oscillation, a loop.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z::[&quot;How could movements of deterritorialization and processes of reterritorialization not be relative, always connected, caught up in one another? The orchid deterritorializes by forming an image, a tracing of a wasp; but the wasp reterritorializes on that image. The wasp is nevertheless deterritorialized, becoming a piece in the orchid&#x27;s reproductive apparatus. But it reterritorializes the orchid by transporting its pollen. Wasp and orchid, as heterogeneous elements, form a rhizome.&quot; ATP10:1]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affirm (◕ᴗ◕✿)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D::[Symmetry. Congruent parts can be [rotated&#x2F;reflected&#x2F;translated::repositioned and reoriented] to be symmetrical. Symmetry can imply a whole that is split into congruent parts. Symmetry also denotes a transformation, a reflection. Symmetry from the perspective of the individual parts in the symmetrical object mark reflections onto each other, and those boundaries denote a rather curious barrier: a subject::object line.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;C::[I&#x27;m trying to force subjects and objects into geometric symmetry, though: I think there&#x27;s something here, but I&#x27;m marking a dead end. Scrap this, move on.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affirm (◕ᴗ◕✿)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D::[What are the material::social implications of these permutations? This seemingly varies across people, though mommy trained us well to be used to certain Universal Modes (the way of the write-locked normie). Of contemporary importance are those used to meatspace and those used to the wires, the flesh molds in different ways. Capital&#x27;s deterritorialization of the socius leaves those under its existence disfigured and malleable, open for injections of whatever concoctions find themselves inside. We&#x27;re instilled manners::tendencies::&lt;code&gt;habits&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and then intermingle with bodies across different strata—others]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;C::[I can focus on the things that keep bodies similar, the coordinates that even mark certain material processes as communication to begin with, but these similarities are only related with respect to the paradoxical gaps that bring me from Here to There.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C::[FUCK DUDE. I&#x27;m hovering around the plane of immanence, you stick your head too far into(outo?) the subject-objects and part-wholes and before-after-loops and find yourself in a fuzz that definitely doesn&#x27;t help me with getting better at talking to people but probably places me somewhere around buddhist enlightenment that reminds me I need to stop thinking about this shit because it&#x27;s &lt;em&gt;not the point&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. This is noisy, I&#x27;m going to write more about it (lol), but certainly not here. I&#x27;m frustrated. I can be traced with all these spatio-temporal phenomena, these deltas, the differences, whatever and still find myself struggling to talk when the time comes. I&#x27;m very frustrated. It&#x27;s worth affirming all of this, I really do just need to touch grass and socialize. I was told that I could be swept up under someone else&#x27;s grandstanding meanings for reality if I drew too close to this &lt;code&gt;schizo demon attractor field&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s right, and I think that&#x27;s exactly right: I&#x27;m way too far beyond trying to be reconciled into some bullshit that pretends to make a greater meaning of it all (it&#x27;s literally &lt;em&gt;not the point&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;); I know that if I attach to someone who makes me feel understood, who understands and cares about me, I&#x27;m giving them a loaded shotgun that could blow up into my face at any moment. Trust is hard to come by.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Number—&lt;code&gt;Present Day, Present Time&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;: elongated, kneaded and worked, pinned
over a garish bed of pig shit (no offense to the shit) by two (copyright) Smiley© faces
on either side. Tearing to the effluvium, incorporating it, kneading it into itself,
shitting again as it tears, over and over. Don&#x27;t worry about baking it doll, that&#x27;ll
come later! What do you mean, you don&#x27;t like the bread? You know how long your daddy
spent kneading it? I&#x27;ll be sure to cut out all the parts with the shit in it after,
sweet little thing. Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;ll turn out just like Gordon Ramsay Iron Chef Fancy

Don&#x27;t worry&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve been wanting to read more Mark Fisher, the little that I&#x27;ve read has tickled me in
ways that I&#x27;m rather fond of. He talks about time, and I know time gets brought up a lot
in the (&quot;Post-left&quot;? &quot;schizoid left&quot;? &quot;CCRU-ey shit&quot;??? I don&#x27;t like words, you&#x27;ll know
what I mean of course :3) social circles and rivers of conscious I return to time and
time again. I think about &quot;memory&quot; a lot too, with respect to Deleuze-Guattari&#x27;s
attribution of cruelty to the inscribing socius:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It [culture] makes men or their organs into the parts and wheels of the social machine.
The sign is a position of desire; but the first signs are the territorial signs that
plant their flags in bodies. And if one wants to call this inscription in naked flesh
&quot;writing,&quot; then it must be said that speech in fact presupposes writing, and that it is
this cruel system of inscribed signs that renders man capable of language, and gives him
a memory of the spoken word.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;AO145:1&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time and Memory, these things occupy my space. There are little bugs (they look exactly
like this -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;3(8)(8)[...](8):3&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;) that tell me that the flesh constantly
retrospects, always presently looking into pasts to make decisions into futures. present
pasts, presently past futures, presently past goods, presently past bads, presently past
drones, cakes, money, shit, etc, and so on, and so forth, etc. Simple enough? There&#x27;s
probably a lot more that gets said on this. Is this The Eternal Return?(???)
Memories lie in the domain of the production of recording, since it is only Experiences
(allegedly) themselves that get the bite of cake, that are the first to fall back upon
the body without organs. Your flesh may mnemotechnically call upon the experience again,
and you get a second experience, copying the memory of the first—well,,,,, memory#2
smells now, it&#x27;s decayed, rotting....no, morphed, and places itself in the present
again, for just a moment, folding unto itself. And if the flesh desires-remembering, it
will find itself marking bodies of itself-as-kin. Explicit memories find themselves
rememberable. Marks are not always explicit, I think they&#x27;re habitual (as David Hume
intended), and ingrain themselves in our social production like wives tens of thousands
of years ago obfuscating their menstrual patterns in ways that empower themselves
against coomer-brained husbands (desiring-sex), birthing healthier children with more
grey matter (...and more memories, hell with it all). This is some stuff to do with a
response to the initial zine that was talking about, critiquing it for trying to create
mythos, and then in turn &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;libcom.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;gender-egalitarianism-made-us-human-response-david-graeber-david-wengrows-how-change-course&quot;&gt;seemingly creating more mythos, this baking a naturalist feminism.&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, you can ignore any implications of the words I say as a means to try to
mark a beginning point to memory or fascism or eden-as-egalitarianism or whatever, I
only really hope to dig into the process of remembering::explicit
memories&#x2F;forgetting::implicit memories, and why I don&#x27;t like remembering the same things
again and again. Forgive my vitalisms. Back to the implicit marks-&amp;gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some secrets which do not permit themselves to be told. Men die nightly in
their beds, wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them piteously in the
eyes—die with despair of heart and convulsion of throat, on account of the hideousness
of mysteries which will not suffer themselves to be revealed. Now and then, alas, the
conscience of man takes up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only
into the grave. And thus the essence of all crime is undivulged.
&lt;em&gt;The Man of the Crowd&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, John Poe (maybe)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habit, &quot;coded flow&quot;, &quot;implicit marks&quot;, &quot;the subconscious&quot;, &quot;untold secrets&quot;, a bit
obscure but as it goes with words steered by things (◕‿◕✿). I found this text when
cruising the wire for commentary on Grand Narratives, specifically invocations of
psychoanalytic Great Men and Unruly Crowds, as described by DG when explaining the
segregative uses of Oedipus, and the nauseating texts that follow Oedipus (around p102).
John Poe I think tugs at this from a cute perspective, in this story wherein the Main
Character&#x27;s (&lt;strong&gt;key&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: subject&#x27;s) observation of a supposed Great Man
walking the streets of London leads him to follow, to learn his truths, his undivulged
crimes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These secrets are at a glance very grounded in the MC&#x27;s explicit framings. They read the
countenances of those in the crowd constantly, create groupings, shared behaviors, whole
stories, belongings (segregations), as intuitively as any glorious modernist should. But
upon seeing the great man, MC finds him cryptic, MC finds a secret they cannot tell, and
lo and behold, it&#x27;s something that cannot be gathered in the explicit, in the conscious,
in the subject.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He follows The man, who spends all time following crowds, getting nervous upon finding
himself alone on certain streets, tracing and retracing steps, until night falls and day
breaks and he cycles once again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as the shades of the second evening came on, I grew wearied unto death, and,
stopping fully in front of the wanderer, gazed at him steadfastly in the face. He
noticed me not, but resumed his solemn walk, while I, ceasing to follow, remained
absorbed in contemplation. &quot;This old man,&quot; I said at length, &quot;is the type and the genius
of deep crime. He refuses to be alone. He is the man of the crowd. It will be in vain to
follow; for I shall learn no more of him, nor of his deeds. The worst heart of the world
is a grosser book than the &#x27;Hortulus Animæ,&#x27; and perhaps it is but one of the great
mercies of God that &lt;em&gt;&#x27;er lasst sich nicht lesen&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&quot;
&lt;em&gt;The Man of the Crowd&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, John Poe (maybe)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is The Man just the crowd? Seemingly, but MC can&#x27;t frame him, can&#x27;t make sense of him.
But where&#x27;s the man then? If you were paying attention, these kinds of dualisms that let
people dissociate themselves into crowds or men are nauseating psychoanalytic garbage to
begin with. The Man&#x27;s secret is one that cannot be told, because these secrets like many
transcend the subject-object, and exist much beyond us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#x27;s this got to do with memory (asking for a friend)? Well, if memories are
&quot;explicit&quot; markings, then we can relate them to the &quot;implicit&quot; markings of habit as
discernible secrets, and furthermore a truth of &quot;real&quot; secrets, secrets that do not
permit themselves to be told. The &quot;explicit&quot;&#x2F;&quot;implicit&quot; differentiation of secrets is
strictly undecidable in the same way that the whole of Oedipus is strictly undecidable
(src: trust me bro), and so in this case, remembering and forgetting are on the same
side of the coin.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the Man have memories? Explicit::Implicit? We can surely draw a pretty little story
about the man&#x27;s flesh, its movements like rhythms, divide its steps into BPMs, and make
a cool Victorian jungle track out of it, but I mostly orbited this story as a means for
drawing a few lines that would help me orient myself, and then moving on. I&#x27;ll forget
about this question just a bit later.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#x27;s on the other side of the coin? Well, real secrets that cannot be spoken.
Desiring-Production, of course.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is an authentic lunatic? He is a man who has preferred to become what is
socially understood as mad rather than forfeit a certain superior idea of human honour.
In its asylums, society has managed to strangle all those it has wished to rid itself of
or to defend itself from, because they refused to make themselves accomplices to various
flagrant dishonesties. For a lunatic is also a man whom society has not wished to listen
to, and whom it is determined to prevent from uttering unbearable truths.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Van Gogh, the man Suicided by Society&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, John Artraud&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;

G::[ending the process::perpetuating the process indefinitely] &lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
G::[The work of the inscribing socius]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering is just like forgetting, especially when we can look forward or back in that
boring in-between from one amnesia to another, and see smiley faces :3&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this helps reconcile my gripes with how much
&lt;code&gt;Present Day, Present Time&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; is full of shit that makes us constantly
oscillate between the two. Ames in 2025:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;microplastics which help us forget easier, just so we can remember once again ^-^&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ad-revenue from children incentivizing content that appeals to everyone with money
(including those who will have money, in teh futur ofc :3)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ten billion stimulations that cause no extra brain wrinkles, keeping us smooth and
epilated uwu&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;acceleration = regression&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m running out of memory for this so I&#x27;ll leave with this song about dead
nurturer-machines, and the suffering in trying to appropriate divine memory, in
&lt;code&gt;Present Day, Present Time&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;. Don&#x27;t get caught up remembering::forgetting when
you still experience, lest your soul break like rocks to oars.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://buns.gay/thoughts/6-enoughness/">&lt;p&gt;(I&#x27;m grouping same-thoughts &#x2F; related thoughts together. They will be labelled. I like this structuring, but sometimes it may be lacking, so I&#x27;ll very intentionally not label thoughts too.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lie here with suffering bones, suffering blood-vessels and flesh that screams as it disfunctions. I bleed and let, I ache::throb in pain, my body demands no organs and my work demands more work. The body continues to break down, and is along for the ride to compost, someday, sometime.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lie here with fuzz, with blankness, with a keyboard that hums at (guess-record: 15khz. Looking at a frequency generator page, it&#x27;s definitely over 14hz, and less than 16khz. I&#x27;d consider that pretty close). I watched YouTube, and know it&#x27;s a mind-trap.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A::[I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m doing enough.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B::[My father works 6 days a week on autobody work. I&#x27;d hardly see him; Most grades I&#x27;d take the bus to&#x2F;from school around 7 (He&#x27;s already gone to work, though every once in a while I&#x27;d get a drive to school), and then I was back home to interface with a videogame console for most of my life before my father would come back around 10 or 11PM. He&#x27;s been working this trade since he was young.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B::[My mother works every day on and off as a seamstress. &quot;Seamstress&quot; is a rather fuzzy and light way of putting it though; Every person she had done work for would pay her per-piece, and it was always less than minimum wage. I don&#x27;t know what age she had started sewing, but I remember her telling me she had sewn from a very young age. She makes clothes for pets, and various jobs on curtains, local sportsball uniforms, really whatever she&#x27;s given.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B::[My mother also handled homecooked lunches and meals for all of us, most every day. When I was in the hospital as a child for many critical reasons (I always am), for months at a time, she had to cover that, and she did.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B::[I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m doing enough.]i&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B=&amp;gt;[Glorious, the Oedipal triangle.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C::[Discipline]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;C::[Every day I wake up to my alarm set at 7AM. I don&#x27;t lay in bed, because beds are psychological prisons that must be overcome with swiftness and diligence. I&#x27;m thinking of getting a military cot.] C::[When my body doesn&#x27;t fail me, I work at home. I can&#x27;t commute, that&#x27;s illogistical and banned. During my break, either a roommate has made a meal for the house or I go to the kitchen to scratch something for myself, and potentially the group.&lt;&#x2F;del&gt; I don&#x27;t like this thought structure at this moment, because I&#x27;m finding a lot of places where I&#x27;d like to speak differently, and this draft has in effect failed to make my point.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C::[I think a lot about habit, and furthermore, discipline. Imagine for a moment I say &quot;I need to do a lot&quot;, and instead cross that phrase out from your vocabulary. I&#x27;m going to talk about the queer house, as well as other factors that in gestalt affect the actions I undergo.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C::[The queer house is an organ. There are many partials to it, of flesh and of machine. Its persistence is necessarily the &quot;functioning of the organ&quot;. The landlord is part of the organ, fixated on the capital flows, stressing the organs with demands and displacements. I have standards for this organ function. The harms of the standards&#x27; lackings are primed.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C-&amp;gt;D::[People must sleep well. Sleep is good, uninterrupted sleep is best. Sleep keeps you from instability. Please vocalize desire to sleep, please let them rest.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C-&amp;gt;D`::[Bad sleep messes function. People get crankier, people disfunction, people displace themselves, and the group conscious disfunctions for it. Bad sleep is interrupted sleep, bad sleep is too much sleep, bad sleep is REM-less sleep. Your flesh demands better.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C-&amp;gt;E::[People wake up, they get hungry. Food must be produced. No microwave shit, no snacks, no excuses for &quot;food&quot; that are in reality just health-doom-elongators that trap you into low-barrier feeding patterns. The stove must turn on, the eggs must be fried, a stable and staple source of good nutrition that fills the stomach makes for healthy organs. Experimental cooking, the stimulation in finding a new meal that fucks. The glory, the hurrah!, in eating something without an exact outcome that had been composed through the staples at hand, the brains at work, the group conscious&#x27;s preferences and diverse historical cuisines that allow for realms of new flows, new desires, new couplings, It&#x27;s fucking BEAUTIFUL.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C-&amp;gt;E`::[Shit food flows worse behaviors. People get crankier, people get miserabler, and the group conscious disfunctions for it. Demotivated, little personal expression when microwaving a meal. Little interest in experimentation (no, the dozens of consumerist dialects you get of any particular food does not count, there are no good desiring machines at play.)]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C-&amp;gt;F::[Cleanliness. The social space varies depending on standards but the capitalist landlord does not, and the landlord stresses the organ, invades the minds of the group conscious, for they are part of it. We have low-barrier cleaning patterns, and I&#x27;m okay with it. We have a cleaning robot that vacuums and mops, and a litter robot.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C-&amp;gt;F`::[Too much cleaning for whatever reason builds neuroticism, builds compulsion. May be the pattern matching going on, but it&#x27;s interesting to consider a barriered cooking compulsion to that of a barriered cleaning compulsion]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C-&amp;gt;G::[Capital. The social space must keep up with the forces of capital lest face physical expropriation (eviction). The house-organs&#x27; flesh agents with will-power must devote their time to the capital cycle, to keep up rent.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C-&amp;gt;G`::[A powerful barrier. Depending on the work - physical, psychological, personal, even capital limitations are reached. This barrier is demanding and it&#x27;s draining on the flesh agents, and if its demands are ignored it WILL boil over in eviction, in breakdowns, in burnout, in lethargy. Capital is an enemy, and I don&#x27;t personify concepts to make them enemies lightly. The cell without its walls to protect against the forces of reality leave its organs dispersed, though still within the cytoplasmic pus to find new walls (desperately, with little probability)]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C[A:G,A`:G`]=&amp;gt;Z::[Desire. Barriers. Stimulation. Persistence. These words are very important to me. Our desire often flows to the direction of least resistance, though once there is little resistance there is no longer desiring, just flow-state. Barriers are this resistance, and it&#x27;s the BwO that only wants for us all to no longer produce productions, to no longer overcome, to be the catatonic lying in the hot tub. You will persist, but only the persistence you believe in, and at what cost?]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z::[Suffering::Barriers::Interfaces are critical in power-flow. To flow power, you MUST be resilient to the catatonic, and you MUST embrace the barriers, the shitty interfaces to your desire, the process of suffering, of breaking down, inherent to the desiring machine. To do this is to persist with power-flow, with embrace of change, with the kind of power that pushes you to keep your deeply loved ones empowered themselves, as my parents had done for me - To keep the group conscious empowered.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Z`::[This is NOT to be interpreted as a fatalistic succumb to the suffering you experience, but a cherishing of the sufferings that brings you stimulation::life-meaning, and a degree of &lt;em&gt;Discipline&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; that leaves you empowered enough to change that which serves to otherize and crush you.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y::[I was watching LilMaijin once and someone had told him after he had lost some match something along the lines of - to not fret; he&#x27;s already so good, he can take some breaks, he&#x27;s &quot;earned&quot; it. And to that he responded with words that were filled with compulsion, NOT with dissatisfaction for his performance either, but instead with emphasis on iteration. He must drive himself to improve, not for some idealized end-state, but solely to &lt;em&gt;be better&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. I hate that I can&#x27;t clip the source, as I don&#x27;t remember, but it gave me a peek into a competitive player&#x27;s mindset, the mindset of someone who, seen as a black box, can output high performance.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;amy::[I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m doing enough, and I think these thoughts always come after I&#x27;ve engaged in resolving a barrier I felt was low, engaged in an action I see as having pacified me in some way, closer to a catatonic flow. I&#x27;m only content when I suffer through reality, and when I genuinely feel like I&#x27;ve done something beautiful in that suffering. There&#x27;s a contrast here though, in physical limits and burnout, that makes for the ultimate grinder a timebomb. Something to read about, I think Byung-Chul Han talks about burnout.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://buns.gay/thoughts/5-empathy-sympathy/">&lt;p&gt;(I&#x27;m grouping same-thoughts &#x2F; related thoughts together. They will be labelled)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A::[I can very broadly tell apart two modes of communication I engaged in the past, polarized around a period that was just pretty harsh all around: Harsh on my body, radical nutrition habits (eggo waffles+soylent, solid-huel, soylent); harsh on my thoughts, unstimulated, drug-bound, constantly-incessantly anxious, quick to flip, quick to cry, quick to appease. &quot;Felt in Intensive Quantities.&quot; Lets call this period &quot;zero&quot;. (I don&#x27;t care that this fucks up some of the meanings of relational attractions-oppositions. &quot;Zero&quot; state is supposed to be an unstimulated BwO. In this case, it&#x27;s the exact opposite)]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A::[There was a time in my life where I had extremely self-destructive habits&#x2F;feedbacks, and the way I thought about others was different before and after this. Lets call this time &quot;zero&quot;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B::[Nowadays I&#x27;m focused around micro-sociopolitical circuits with the folks I &quot;spend time with&quot;. We share a house. I (image of myself) leverage my capital power to ensure machines keep moving, and in ways that can be reproducable::repeated::habited::cyclical. I think about stratified&#x2F;smooth space, and try to create stratified systems that can be easy to stim::follow, while also trying to encourage a level of flexibility::open-mindness::smoothness to my suggestions so as to keep social space reserved for completely different ideas or thoughts. This is mostly just external though.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B::[Nowadays I just focus on keeping everyone around me empowered, in ways that can be summed up as structural and financial.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C::[Everything freezes. Inhale. A moment. Exhale. A housemate of mine is despondent. I struggle to find the words to ask them about their lived reality. I&#x27;ll probably say two or three different sentences that don&#x27;t &quot;connect&quot;, before swallowing my pride and using words that are (imo) loaded, but more understandable (against my wishes for a &quot;&quot;&quot;clearer&quot;&quot;&quot; communication).]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C::[Everything freezes. Inhale. A moment. Exhale. A housemate of mine repents. Repenting feels to me incredibly arbitrary - blame::fault::accountability rings hollow. I think I know what it&#x27;s like to repent: I know I don&#x27;t know all the ways in which someone may repent; I know people don&#x27;t need a reason to repent; I know people sometimes have direct&#x2F;indirect ties to religious flow that introduce certain ideas of repentance into our minds; I know that repenting can be to some people just a form of thorough thinking to determine how the future ought to be different. Before and during zero, I regularly repented with a cat-o-nine-tails, because I saw Lady Farnese repent with a flog once &lt;a href=&quot;..&#x2F;static&#x2F;farnese.jpg&quot;&gt;Berserk Vol.17 Ch&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It wasn&#x27;t repenting as much as it was. A housemate of mine repents, THEY tell me repenting. I can&#x27;t just throw out the word-action that pops in my mind for their actions - If I did, I&#x27;d abandon all words. My interfaces for such a reality-state - assuming the goal of empowering all those around me - is only machining. I&#x27;m sympathizing, and I&#x27;m empathizing, in the beloved theatre of mind, and yet I&#x27;m also not. A housemate of mine repents. I can talk to them. They can explain to me their systems, their lack-thereofs, I&#x27;ll try to absorb everything. I&#x27;ll try to mold my own brain into theirs and &quot;&quot;understand&quot;&quot;.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C::[&quot;I&#x27;m sorry you&#x27;re going through this&quot;]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D::[This empathy::sympathy dicho feels so lacking. I know that I&#x27;m trying to empower, and that&#x27;s a presumption in of itself.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D::[To try to make a situation better intra-personally and externally, I could be sympathizing. I&#x27;d offer advice, I&#x27;d persecute their system and offer them a turn of the celibate machine to understand that XYZ could help. I could not offer advice, allowing their system to remain uncontested. I need to interface at some point. It&#x27;s compulsive, even.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D::[To try to make a situation better intrapersonally, I could be empathetic. I could -E::[Wait, what the fuck does empathy even entail? I can perform all the empathy I want (see C) but it doesn&#x27;t feel like empathy to me. Maybe I&#x27;m just one of the legendary, so-called, often self-proclaimed &lt;em&gt;empaths&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Maybe I&#x27;m so far detached from universals that all I can do is sympathize, and interface, for those are the only tools I&#x27;ve allowed myself to withold.]]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E::[Thinking about everything around me is necessarily a different state than not thinking about everything around me. The former state feels those analytic convergences. The former state provides textbook manipulation to discover the right series of words to use in order to empower the other. The former state, in compulsive, incessant, persecutive form, is the cult leader. It&#x27;s Potential for absolute &quot;efficiency&quot;, number crunching, stratified space, subversive behaviors and psychologik fields of study.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E::[I don&#x27;t like this damned Sym&#x2F;Emp dichotomy. It forces you to &quot;put yourself in the others shoes::really &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; them&quot; OR &quot;pity::CBT::DBT::offer advice&quot;, with seemingly continuous, but ultimately discrete permutations of states and options. I&#x27;m using so many words for it too but usually people don&#x27;t put much thought at all into empathy or sympathy. It comes to them seemingly naturally (miraculating?)]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F::[People suffer, and those who suffer around me are subject to my responses. [A masterfully crafted dud::a thoughtful response::a brief, shallow interpretation::an overthought, overstimulated impedance]::=&amp;gt;[Uncalled-for judgement::deeply needed advice::an overused saying::a schizophrenic gibberish]]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F::[[A little stratification::a communal understanding of the situation at hand], but with emphasis on loving. Let me know if you think of anything better.]&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://buns.gay/thoughts/4-dopamine-machines/">&lt;p&gt;I am in conflict with dopamine machines. I am in conflict with AI. I am in conflict with humanism and anti-humanism, and related, in conflict with free will.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get so overwhelmed thinking about any of this as I type it out, so please bear potential ramblings.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine machines. I think a lot about my friends who watch mind-rotting nothing-content whose only purpose behind the content being made is to stick eyes on it for as long as possible (ultimately for capital gain). I try to otherize some of these forms of content, but I think gauging whether something is mind-rotting can get really fuzzy really quickly. At the core of it is a capital incentive to make content that keeps attention the most, and this incentive has been around forever but it&#x27;s only been recently that I&#x27;ve felt like it&#x27;s truly refined to such a state that it&#x27;s interfacing and exploiting our brains near directly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content Farms &#x2F; Shortform content (Tiktok, YT Shorts). RNG &quot;contests&quot;&#x2F;&quot;sports&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;wMdEYy4mc3o&quot;&gt;ex&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. These are comparable to legalized slot machines. You gain no knowledge. You gain no understanding of others. You don&#x27;t create anything. You get a stim with a purpose only to be replaced by the next video. You&#x27;re doing nothing, and that&#x27;s not necessarily wrong.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related: Iconography&#x2F;UX - Like a tic, you pick up your phone and press your thumb on the surface to let yourself inside. You click the button that shows all your apps, and are presented with a multitude of colors that you&#x27;ve habitually assigned to various different mechanations. You click the app you deserve, and make slight motions over other slight motions (thumb likely) like a child tugging at its mother&#x27;s dress for a new toy, everlasting comfortable &quot;enjoyment&quot;, its next fix. But you no longer exist in this moment - the partial-object form that once tied desire-&amp;gt;arm-&amp;gt;hand-&amp;gt;phone is more gestaltic to the machines that generate algorithmic dividualization, than the meatbag involved in anything more &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;fulfilling&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final Fantasy XIV - Para-textual sources (e.g. wikis) making mistakes something that shouldn&#x27;t happen. &quot;Unoptimal play&quot; is discouraged and given less leniency. I feel a lot of the times like I&#x27;m just pressing buttons As God Intended when I want to be analyzing enemies or bosses and trying to on-the-fly learn them or react to things. Ultimates&#x2F;savages blend the two where the only way to complete that content is to play optimally, which I find more acceptable for some reason.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nostalgia Farms - &quot;Corrupting the minds of the youth&quot; with highly manufactured media that was from the ground-up designed for the purposes of Making The Number Bigger and nothing else. Disney princess, so many videogames (especially those pushed by larger power players like US&#x2F;JP Govt and its consequences, though these machines make more than just primarily capital)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had more written here but it&#x27;s significantly later than (17-05813857) (its 17-20915120) so I&#x27;ll put other things somewhere else another time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://buns.gay/thoughts/3-bad-ppl-2/">&lt;p&gt;My head is filled to the brim rent-free with reality deltas I perceive across different folks. It&#x27;s pretty fucking gay. An ex of mine contacted me out of the blue disappointed that after 4 or 5 months since having spoken that I hadn&#x27;t realized that they &quot;weren&#x27;t the bad guy in all of this.&quot; My close friend had her shit broken into and doesn&#x27;t know who to trust anymore, because it very well could have been a fellow tran that did it. I&#x27;ve been told by close friends I love dearly not to interact with certain people because those friends were almost raped by them. I&#x27;ve even been accused of doing terrible awful things myself by people who&#x27;d walk back on it and be friendly with me months later. It&#x27;s frankly frustrating, and obstructively so.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manipulation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a million and one words you could get spat out by the field of psychology to help explain this delta, but I despise the field as a whole and trying to read into humans to try and predict them is prone to misuse and exploitation, and I know too many people who use that shit to twist narratives and get friends to side with one person over the other. Under layers of obfuscation and prae-parared terminology, between webs of stretched half-truths and tactical appeals to &quot;consent&quot; and fairness - Extract from it all the &quot;intent&quot; and malicious acting, and just throw that shit away. People can do these things maliciously, but I&#x27;m sure that most people are hardly aware they&#x27;re actually manipulating. Different value systems and frameworks of reality provide so many nooks and crannies for people with shitty behavior to crawl into, and it&#x27;s just normal to them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology lends itself very well to manipulative behavior, through a false appeal to a hard science that proves for sure that some behavior is a pattern, that people have mental illnesses that make them less valuable than another, that can overtly shield folx from criticism for fear of reviving trauma.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this to say, it&#x27;s damn near fucking impossible to trust people. I remember when the world was small, and I trusted everyone at their word, and took their word as fact. But holy fucking shit, So many people refuse to talk clearly, to own up to realities, to show love for everyone. I get depressed thinking about it. I wish queers at least were better than this, but I end up feeling the opposite with so many queer folx with debilitating behaviors fueled from poor machinations of reality. My gut tells me queers are either staunchly naiive, or staunchly clear and considerate, or staunchly manipulative. This probably has correlations to those types of trannies I taked about during the first &quot;Bad&quot; people thing I wrote.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, the reality delta q.q&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad People.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that our sense of truth in events among humans is utterly cum-fuzzled, that &quot;Bad&quot; people thing kinda gets fucked for it too. It&#x27;s hard to tell what actually happened, hard to squeeze out tendencies or inidual behaviors out of someone to reason about why a specific opportunity lent itself to that person doing a terrible act. What&#x27;screated is this confusion slop (probably tastes like Huel) that&#x27;s hard to escape.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t really know how to deal with all that noise, and I&#x27;m frustrated about it. I think I just end up focusing instead of trying to help those close to me, loaded with paranoia and Foucaultian power dynamics, with efforts to minimize where I can and help people out regardless of the reality I view them in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve given $16k to people who utterly wrecked havoc on my life because they were moving out of my apartment and I didn&#x27;t want them to go homeless as much as they admitted to fucking with me emotionally and intentionally making strides to split me apart from people who were incredibly dear to me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave $3k to a person I only actually learned about that day because they needed money for an electric wheelchair, and I know how that is.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently met some completely random people on Taimi who were apparently trying to escape from a really shitty home situation and now they&#x27;re crashing in my apartment for the next couple months while they get footing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I help pay most the rent for someone who used to be homeless, and who I hardly ever see. They say they&#x27;re saving up for college.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I leave this apartment for a new job I&#x27;m going to still be covering it because my wife and other queers can hardly hold jobs and can&#x27;t cover rent on their own.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put thousands of dollars into queer folx&#x27;s gofundmes, of whom I&#x27;ve been told have done shitty manipulative stuff, and who I should not interact with.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But am I a good person? Fucking shrug. I focus more on whether people do good or bad actions, and have some universal value system that places strangers to the same degree of importance as close friends. Is it the truest sexiest moral system? Fucking shrug. I don&#x27;t care, dilate about it. I think what&#x27;s important though is just that I try to love all humans as much as I can, and I end up reducing my love only to queers but it&#x27;s something I can handle at least.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I end this long post as unsatisfied and confused as I was when I started.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://buns.gay/thoughts/1-short-schpeel/">&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m pretty stressed out. It&#x27;s manageable, it always is, kinda. Managability makes sense,
though whether something is manageable makes less sense. I&#x27;ve been reading Anti-Oedipus
and I&#x27;ll be able to make connections between it and managability through some kind of
weird desiring-machine (or whatever the fuck. I&#x27;m only on chapter 2 and I&#x27;m reading
slow, be nice). The capital machine produces working-stress machine produces
overwhelming-amy machines produces amy-willpower. (not very good at this (u cud say a
minor-product of these machines is brainfuzz-stupid.bitch.energy machines))&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interview grind is gay. Techies suffer for it (not a bad thing).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m tired. I&#x27;m so tired. Those desires to just be taken care of by a tech tran who can
keep me safe is a trap. Never ever fall for this. More will to power is needed and those
desires reduce productivity of will-powers. Comfort produced by the weight of the eyes -
ecstasy in the soreness of the spine - love-drunk happiness when fingers stiff and
concentration is short.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readdress yourself. Edit the brain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m so tired.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to write more on the &quot;Bad people&quot; thing,I spoke with a close friend Izz about it
and I think there&#x27;s a lot to it. Off the top of my head, I don&#x27;t think people are just
&quot;rapists&quot;, its more just that they have &quot;rapey&quot; behaviors that can fly under the radar
most the time but once in a blue moon, when everything lines up, that &quot;rapey&quot; behavior
causes a lot of harm to someone. I was thinking this when thinking about a few times
when I was going to interact with someone I didn&#x27;t know very well and a close friend
would tell me that they did terrible terrible things. When I actually end up hanging out
with them, nothing bad happens, or alternatively when talking to them about the
situation their reality is incredibly different.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ll probably get to writing more about it so I can organize my thoughts better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://buns.gay/thoughts/2-queer-culture/">&lt;p&gt;It really does feel like everyone has a drug problem these days, Schneeweis.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[REDACTED] is a ket addict, smoking weed every week and still buying packs of Newports and throwing them out after taking a couple. Money is tight, but that doesn&#x27;t matter! Damaged goods!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[REDACTED] is doing coke, ket, and weed. Pretty depressed, pretty empty. That feeling of the lack of control of the body is apparent.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[REDACTED] is a lifelong opioid addict. Phenibut, Gabapentin, the works.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[REDACTED] was overdosing outside the apartment off heroin or worse. Thank god for Narcan. Hell to Nitazines.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[REDACTED] really likes speed, has an ADHD prescription coincidentally. Wants meth, takes drugs for the fun of it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[REDACTED] takes ket to forget about the gnawing disconnection with anyone around.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[REDACTED] has an apartment littered with whippits. Weed is everyday, every time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[REDACTED] smokes Marlboro reds (gross), sniffs poppers, and hopes to drug themselves to the point of vegetation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[REDACTED] used to do so much DXM, and now focuses on ket. Brain fried. DXM is the devil.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[REDACTED]&#x27;s brain broke after enough DXM. Hatred of those once close, paranoia. DXM is the devil.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[REDACTED] likes speed. Smokes too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[REDACTED] can&#x27;t do molly or acid anymore. The presence of Xanax causes anxiety, Ketamine causes want. Former smoker.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[REDACTED] is never not on acid. Raves for molly and ket.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[REDACTED] feels safe when on ket.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To call this a problem is incorrect - but it&#x27;s floating around correctness. I never really understood what an addiction was before actually getting a drug addiction that&#x27;s marked societally as one. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but the one thought that permeates my mind most about them is the subversiveness. You never know you&#x27;re addicted until you step back and see things at a distance. It&#x27;s similar to finding out whether partners are manipulative - individual actions will never really show you much. Even then, its still difficult.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reality gives the impression that addictions are very discrete entities.  You play Fallout, you do the drug-sounding drug, and after you take a specific amount you&#x27;ll be notified that you&#x27;re addicted to XYZ. After exactly VVV days, -5% Max health, -3% Movement speed, 5% less damage dealt. You know exactly what&#x27;s going on, you get direct feedback on how you&#x27;re &quot;suffering&quot;, and there is no psychological desire present. In reality, you never see your life fall apart when you do drugs. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t even fall apart at all. But other times, you miss an assignment. You didn&#x27;t maximize job finding because you spent 20 hours a week high and now money is getting tight. You just really need a cigarette. You&#x27;re hanging out with folx who get you to try DXM, and now you just have another tool for fun to do at home, to relieve that stress, to feel nice.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t want to demonize drugs, or even imply them as solely harmful. Ultimately, folx do what they want with the reality given, and given an incessant capital machine and little outs for enjoyment, it&#x27;s pretty optimal to go to raves and bump ket. It&#x27;s rough though, it&#x27;s really rough.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugs make me sad. They make me think of the community of people that I relate to at the root, the people I&#x27;ll try to protect to my last breath, and I get sad. I get really sad.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-desc&quot;&gt;
This is a set of varying glitch I performed on a couple photos of one of the abandoned
military bunkers that litter the areas around Seattle. There&#x27;s two original photos in total:
the former (sirvs) being manipulated via pixel sort and channel shift; the latter (hall)
being corrupted via jpeg corruption. Some of the jpeg corruption pieces are so corrupt that
they will not load. This is intentional :3

&lt;div class=&quot;gallery-desc&quot;&gt;
This is some glitch based on some photos from someone I met thru a mutual. I like this set
because it goes to show how much pixel sorting can vary when it comes to visual appeal,
since the persimmon leaf photo didn&#x27;t really do much when sorted, but the big tree did a
whole lot. Theres a lot of reasons for it, but I&#x27;m not going to get into it.

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://buns.gay/thoughts/0-bad-people/">&lt;p&gt;i&#x27;ve thought a lot about bad people, and i&#x27;m not so sure why but it doesn&#x27;t really change a whole lot in my head when i do anymore. i think i just want to try and make something as vague and loaded as the concept of evil into something that makes sense, which is fruitless.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone who I think has gone through a whole lot of shit in their life told me a while ago that 1&#x2F;6 trannies are pretty vile people. Just awful, shitty, horrible people, usually showing itself in egotistical folks, rapey energy, lying and manipulation, etcetera. I didn&#x27;t think hard about it for the longest time, but honestly at this point after having met so many folx and seeing how much suffering we cause each other I get where they&#x27;re coming from.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m scared of a lot of people. &quot;Scared&quot; isn&#x27;t the right word either, it&#x27;s more that I&#x27;m hesitant. I can hardly build any relationship with a cishet person because I&#x27;ve already blown out my interests and mannerisms to degrees that only queer folx can understand, and even then there&#x27;s this extra layer of shit you need to sift through for me to feel comfortable being alone in a room with you. There&#x27;s anxiety concentrate - and that 1&#x2F;6 number -- and those experiences I&#x27;ve had with other queers as well as what I&#x27;ve seen in other people. People aren&#x27;t evil. I don&#x27;t hold hate for anyone, reality already makes little enough sense that trying to apply some hate method to my black box would probably just be frustrating.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cis folx can be terrible. Those people still wholely inside get jealous easily, ingrained with archaic concepts of role fulfillment, blinded by blood and legacy. But they&#x27;re not in control. They were write locked by capital automata and societal norm after getting their brains baked to be perfect little bricks in the wall.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trannies vary. I&#x27;m speaking on trans people my age or a bit below, older gen trans folx are another interesting topic that I don&#x27;t have the brain power to get into right now. They&#x27;d probably fill out another bullet here, though. There&#x27;s a gradient to this all too, My only goal is to mark vague traits and typical thoughts on a line from hinged to unhinged.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Queers and trannies who grew up with loving parents, in middle class households 		where their greatest hardship was getting misgendered in high school. They&#x27;re pretty 		binary brained, pretty mono, pretty vanilla. These folx care too much about their 		labels, whether its mental illnesses or gender dichotomies or status. I&#x27;ve met some 		insufferable trans folx who grew up rich, who are completely integrated into their 		class culture and normative culture. These folx stress me out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Queers and trannies who went through a lot of shit. I think most trans folx I know 		grew up pretty fucked. Little to no solace found in the meatspace, usually relying 		on the wired to fill that space in the soul. Lots of mental fuckery, and outside 		societal norms for the most part. They&#x27;re still hanging onto labels, the ones based 		in psychology. Neurodivergence, mental illnesses, mental disorders. I hold nothing 		but sympathy, but despise the filed of psychology as a whole. They can shed the 		labels. You don&#x27;t need the capital automata&#x27;s fleeting imposition of reality, you 		can create your own. Only some trannies that&#x27;ve gone through shit understand that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I cling onto that concept of &quot;hardship&quot; a bit too much, because ultimately it&#x27;s based on some standard for life &quot;difficulty&quot; that has some merit to it but is a bit oversimplistic. Humans all go through things that&#x27;re difficult to them. Some humans go through things that stray from the universal greatly and end up making them way more tuned with the outside. The hardship shit also always comes off as a dick measuring contest too, which I detest.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born with spina bifida. I&#x27;m permanently wheelchair bound. I grew up a nazi, whiplashed into a commie, and then settled into a paranoid anarchism. I have a hard time feeling like I have a self. My brain is plagued into a mindset entirely concerned with truth and power (ty foucault &amp;lt;3). I&#x27;ve hurt people that care about me, and holy fuck I am so fucking sensitive to anything that comes off as manipulative. I went on a drug bender that landed me in the hospital for a month and blood thinners + compression socks for life after getting fucked with for months by people who I trusted with my life. My expected lifespan is somewhere in the 40s or earlier. I think it&#x27;s fair to say I&#x27;ve gone through some shit, but again, no emphasis on a dick measuring contest.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People infantilize me a lot since I&#x27;m a wheelchair fag, which is nice because I get away with a lot of shit. I&#x27;m not very intimidating, which helps me not get super stressed because people just tend to be trusting and I can be super forward as a result. I&#x27;m surprisingly mentally stable, and have a values system that denies me the timeline where I ever rope. Shits fucked but god do I love trying to make the most of it !!!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
