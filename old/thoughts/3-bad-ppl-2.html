				<div class="thought-title">[1683833638]: "Bad" people two</div>
				<div class="thought-body">
					<div>
						My head is filled to the brim rent-free with reality deltas I perceive across different
						folks. It's pretty fucking gay. An ex of mine contacted me out of the blue disappointed
						that after 4 or 5 months since having spoken that I hadn't realized that they "weren't
						the bad guy in all of this." My close friend had her shit broken into and doesn't know
						who to trust anymore, because it very well could have been a fellow tran that did it.
						I've been told by close friends I love dearly not to interact with certain people
						because those friends were almost raped by them. I've even been accused of doing
						terrible awful things myself by people who'd walk back on it and be friendly with me
						months later. It's frankly frustrating, and obstructively so.
					</div>

					<div>Manipulation.</div>
					<div>
						There's a million and one words you could get spat out by the field of psychology to
						help explain this delta, but I despise the field as a whole and trying to read into
						humans to try and predict them is prone to misuse and exploitation, and I know too many
						people who use that shit to twist narratives and get friends to side with one person
						over the other. Under layers of obfuscation and prae-parared terminology, between webs
						of stretched half-truths and tactical appeals to "consent" and fairness - Extract from
						it all the "intent" and malicious acting, and just throw that shit away. People can do
						these things maliciously, but I'm sure that most people are hardly aware they're
						actually manipulating. Different value systems and frameworks of reality provide so many
						nooks and crannies for people with shitty behavior to crawl into, and it's just normal
						to them.
					</div>

					<div>
						Psychology lends itself very well to manipulative behavior, through a false appeal to a
						hard science that proves for sure that some behavior is a pattern, that people have
						mental illnesses that make them less valuable than another, that can overtly shield folx
						from criticism for fear of reviving trauma.
					</div>

					<div>
						All this to say, it's damn near fucking impossible to trust people. I remember when the
						world was small, and I trusted everyone at their word, and took their word as fact. But
						holy fucking shit, So many people refuse to talk clearly, to own up to realities, to
						show love for everyone. I get depressed thinking about it. I wish queers at least were
						better than this, but I end up feeling the opposite with so many queer folx with
						debilitating behaviors fueled from poor machinations of reality. My gut tells me queers
						are either staunchly naiive, or staunchly clear and considerate, or staunchly
						manipulative. This probably has correlations to those types of trannies I taked about
						during the first "Bad" people thing I wrote.
					</div>

					<div>Hence, the reality delta q.q</div>

					<div>Bad People.</div>

					<div>
						Now that our sense of truth in events among humans is utterly cum-fuzzled, that "Bad"
						people thing kinda gets fucked for it too. It's hard to tell what actually happened,
						hard to squeeze out tendencies or individual behaviors out of someone to reason about
						why a specific opportunity lent itself to that person doing a terrible act. What's
						created is this confusion slop (probably tastes like Huel) that's hard to escape.
					</div>

					<div>
						I don't really know how to deal with all that noise, and I'm frustrated about it. I
						think I just end up focusing instead of trying to help those close to me, loaded with
						paranoia and Foucaultian power dynamics, with efforts to minimize where I can and help
						people out regardless of the reality I view them in.
					</div>

					<div>
						I've given $16k to people who utterly wrecked havoc on my life because they were moving
						out of my apartment and I didn't want them to go homeless as much as they admitted to
						fucking with me emotionally and intentionally making strides to split me apart from
						people who were incredibly dear to me.
					</div>

					<div>
						I gave $3k to a person I only actually learned about that day because they needed money
						for an electric wheelchair, and I know how that is.
					</div>

					<div>
						I recently met some completely random people on Taimi who were apparently trying to
						escape from a really shitty home situation and now they're crashing in my apartment for
						the next couple months while they get footing.
					</div>

					<div>
						I help pay most the rent for someone who used to be homeless, and who I hardly ever see.
						They say they're saving up for college.
					</div>

					<div>
						When I leave this apartment for a new job I'm going to still be covering it because my
						wife and other queers can hardly hold jobs and can't cover rent on their own.
					</div>

					<div>
						I put thousands of dollars into queer folx's gofundmes, of whom I've been told have done
						shitty manipulative stuff, and who I should not interact with.
					</div>

					<div>
						But am I a good person? Fucking shrug. I focus more on whether people do good or bad
						actions, and have some universal value system that places strangers to the same degree
						of importance as close friends. Is it the truest sexiest moral system? Fucking shrug. I
						don't care, dilate about it. I think what's important though is just that I try to love
						all humans as much as I can, and I end up reducing my love only to queers but it's
						something I can handle at least.
					</div>

					<div>I end this long post as unsatisfied and confused as I was when I started.</div>
