						I'm pretty stressed out. It's manageable, it always is, kinda. Managability makes sense,
						though whether something is manageable makes less sense. I've been reading Anti-Oedipus
						and I'll be able to make connections between it and managability through some kind of
						weird desiring-machine (or whatever the fuck. I'm only on chapter 2 and I'm reading
						slow, be nice). The capital machine produces working-stress machine produces
						overwhelming-amy machines produces amy-willpower. (not very good at this (u cud say a
						minor-product of these machines is brainfuzz-stupid.bitch.energy machines))
					</div>
					<div>Interview grind is gay. Techies suffer for it (not a bad thing).</div>
					<div>
						I'm tired. I'm so tired. Those desires to just be taken care of by a tech tran who can
						keep me safe is a trap. Never ever fall for this. More will to power is needed and those
						desires reduce productivity of will-powers. Comfort produced by the weight of the eyes -
						ecstasy in the soreness of the spine - love-drunk happiness when fingers stiff and
						concentration is short.
					</div>
					<div>Readdress yourself. Edit the brain.</div>
					<div>I'm so tired.</div>
					<div>
						I want to write more on the "Bad people" thing,I spoke with a close friend Izz about it
						and I think there's a lot to it. Off the top of my head, I don't think people are just
						"rapists", its more just that they have "rapey" behaviors that can fly under the radar
						most the time but once in a blue moon, when everything lines up, that "rapey" behavior
						causes a lot of harm to someone. I was thinking this when thinking about a few times
						when I was going to interact with someone I didn't know very well and a close friend
						would tell me that they did terrible terrible things. When I actually end up hanging out
						with them, nothing bad happens, or alternatively when talking to them about the
						situation their reality is incredibly different.
					</div>
					<div>
						I'll probably get to writing more about it so I can organize my thoughts better.
