					I'm pretty stressed out. It's manageable, it always is, kinda. Managability
					makes sense, though whether something is manageable makes less sense. I've been
					reading Anti-Oedipus and I'll be able to make connections between it and
					managability through some kind of weird desiring-machine (or whatever the fuck.
					I'm only on chapter 2 and I'm reading slow, be nice). The capital machine
					produces working-stress machine produces overwhelming-amy machines produces
					amy-willpower. (not very good at this (u cud say a minor-product of these
					machines is brainfuzz-stupid.bitch.energy machines))
				</div>
				<div>Interview grind is gay. Techies suffer for it (not a bad thing).</div>
				<div>
					I'm tired. I'm so tired. Those desires to just be taken care of by a tech tran
					who can keep me safe is a trap. Never ever fall for this. More will to power is
					needed and those desires reduce productivity of will-powers. Comfort produced by
					the weight of the eyes - ecstasy in the soreness of the spine - love-drunk
					happiness when fingers stiff and concentration is short.
				</div>
				<div>Readdress yourself. Edit the brain.</div>
				<div>I'm so tired.</div>
				<div>
					I want to write more on the "Bad people" thing,I spoke with a close friend Izz
					about it and I think there's a lot to it. Off the top of my head, I don't think
					people are just "rapists", its more just that they have "rapey" behaviors that
					can fly under the radar most the time but once in a blue moon, when everything
					lines up, that "rapey" behavior causes a lot of harm to someone. I was thinking
					this when thinking about a few times when I was going to interact with someone I
					didn't know very well and a close friend would tell me that they did terrible
					terrible things. When I actually end up hanging out with them, nothing bad
					happens, or alternatively when talking to them about the situation their reality
					is incredibly different.
				</div>
				<div>
					I'll probably get to writing more about it so I can organize my thoughts better.
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="thoughts-title">1681007598: "Bad" people</div>
			<div class="thoughts-body">
				<div>
					I've thought a lot about bad people, and I'm not so sure why but it doesn't
					really change a whole lot in my head when I do anymore. I think I just want to
					try and make something as vague and loaded as the concept of evil into something
					that makes sense, which is fruitless.
				</div>
				<div>
					Someone who I think has gone through a whole lot of shit in their life told me a
					while ago that 1/6 trannies are pretty vile people. Just awful, shitty, horrible
					people, usually showing itself in egotistical folks, rapey energy, lying and
					manipulation, etcetera. I didn't think hard about it for the longest time, but
					honestly at this point after having met so many folx and seeing how much
					suffering we cause each other I get where they're coming from.
				</div>
				<div>
					I'm scared of a lot of people. "Scared" isn't the right word either, it's more
					that I'm hesitant. I can hardly build any relationship with a cishet person
					because I've already blown out my interests and mannerisms to degrees that only
					queer folx can understand, and even then there's this extra layer of shit you
					need to sift through for me to feel comfortable being alone in a room with you.
					There's anxiety concentrate - and that 1/6 number -- and those experiences I've
					had with other queers as well as what I've seen in other people.
				</div>
				<div>
					People aren't evil. I don't hold hate for anyone, reality already makes little
					enough sense that trying to apply some hate method to my black box would
					probably just be frustrating.
				</div>
				<div>
					Cis folx can be terrible. Those people still wholely inside get jealous easily,
					ingrained with archaic concepts of role fulfillment, blinded by blood and
					legacy. But they're not in control. They were write locked by capital automata
					and societal norm after getting their brains baked to be perfect little bricks
					in the wall.
				</div>
				<div>
					Trannies vary. I'm speaking on trans people my age or a bit below, older gen
					trans folx are another interesting topic that I don't have the brain power to
					get into right now. They'd probably fill out another bullet here, though.
					There's a gradient to this all too, My only goal is to mark vague traits and
					typical thoughts on a line from hinged to unhinged.
					<ul>
						<li>
							Queers and trannies who grew up with loving parents, in middle class
							households where their greatest hardship was getting misgendered in high
							school. They're pretty binary brained, pretty mono, pretty vanilla.
							These folx care too much about their labels, whether its mental
							illnesses or gender dichotomies or status. I've met some insufferable
							trans folx who grew up rich, who are completely integrated into their
							class culture and normative culture. These folx stress me out.
						</li>
						<li>
							Queers and trannies who went through a lot of shit. I think most trans
							folx I know grew up pretty fucked. Little to no solace found in the
							meatspace, usually relying on the wired to fill that space in the soul.
							Lots of mental fuckery, and outside societal norms for the most part.
							They're still hanging onto labels, the ones based in psychology.
							Neurodivergence, mental illnesses, mental disorders. I hold nothing but
							sympathy, but despise the filed of psychology as a whole. They can shed
							the labels. You don't need the capital automata's fleeting imposition of
							reality, you can create your own. Only some trannies that've gone
							through shit understand that.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div>
					I think I cling onto that concept of "hardship" a bit too much, because
					ultimately it's based on some standard for life "difficulty" that has some merit
					to it but is a bit oversimplistic. Humans all go through things that're
					difficult to them. Some humans go through things that stray from the universal
					greatly and end up making them way more tuned with the outside. The hardship
					shit also always comes off as a dick measuring contest too, which I detest.
				</div>
				<div>
					I was born with spina bifida. I'm permanently wheelchair bound. I grew up a
					nazi, whiplashed into a commie, and then settled into a paranoid anarchism. I
					have a hard time feeling like I have a self. My brain is plagued into a mindset
					entirely concerned with truth and power (ty foucault &lt;3). I've hurt people
					that care about me, and holy fuck I am so fucking sensitive to anything that
					comes off as manipulative. I went on a drug bender that landed me in the
					hospital for a month and blood thinners + compression socks for life after
					getting fucked with for months by people who I trusted with my life. My expected
					lifespan is somewhere in the 40s or earlier. I think it's fair to say I've gone
					through some shit, but again, no emphasis on a dick measuring contest.
				</div>
				<div>
					People infantilize me a lot since I'm a wheelchair fag, which is nice because I
					get away with a lot of shit. I'm not very intimidating, which helps me not get
					super stressed because people just tend to be trusting and I can be super
					forward as a result. I'm surprisingly mentally stable, and have a values system
					that denies me the timeline where I ever rope. Shits fucked but god do I love
					trying to make the most of it !!!
