						I'm pretty stressed out. It's manageable, it always is, kinda. Managability
						makes sense, though whether something is manageable makes less sense. I've
						been reading Anti-Oedipus and I'll be able to make connections between it
						and managability through some kind of weird desiring-machine (or whatever
						the fuck. I'm only on chapter 2 and I'm reading slow, be nice). The capital
						machine produces working-stress machine produces overwhelming-amy machines
						produces amy-willpower. (not very good at this (u cud say a minor-product of
						these machines is brainfuzz-stupid.bitch.energy machines))

					<div>Interview grind is gay. Techies suffer for it (not a bad thing).</div>
					<div>
						I'm tired. I'm so tired. Those desires to just be taken care of by a tech
						tran who can keep me safe is a trap. Never ever fall for this. More will to
						power is needed and those desires reduce productivity of will-powers.
						Comfort produced by the weight of the eyes - ecstasy in the soreness of the
						spine - love-drunk happiness when fingers stiff and concentration is short.

						I want to write more on the "Bad people" thing,I spoke with a close friend
						Izz about it and I think there's a lot to it. Off the top of my head, I
						don't think people are just "rapists", its more just that they have "rapey"
						behaviors that can fly under the radar most the time but once in a blue
						moon, when everything lines up, that "rapey" behavior causes a lot of harm
						to someone. I was thinking this when thinking about a few times when I was
						going to interact with someone I didn't know very well and a close friend
						would tell me that they did terrible terrible things. When I actually end up
						hanging out with them, nothing bad happens, or alternatively when talking to
						them about the situation their reality is incredibly different.
					</div>
					<div>
						I'll probably get to writing more about it so I can organize my thoughts
						better.

						I've thought a lot about bad people, and I'm not so sure why but it doesn't
						really change a whole lot in my head when I do anymore. I think I just want
						to try and make something as vague and loaded as the concept of evil into
						something that makes sense, which is fruitless.
					</div>
					<div>
						Someone who I think has gone through a whole lot of shit in their life told
						me a while ago that 1/6 trannies are pretty vile people. Just awful, shitty,
						horrible people, usually showing itself in egotistical folks, rapey energy,
						lying and manipulation, etcetera. I didn't think hard about it for the
						longest time, but honestly at this point after having met so many folx and
						seeing how much suffering we cause each other I get where they're coming
						from.
					</div>
					<div>
						I'm scared of a lot of people. "Scared" isn't the right word either, it's
						more that I'm hesitant. I can hardly build any relationship with a cishet
						person because I've already blown out my interests and mannerisms to degrees
						that only queer folx can understand, and even then there's this extra layer
						of shit you need to sift through for me to feel comfortable being alone in a
						room with you. There's anxiety concentrate - and that 1/6 number -- and
						those experiences I've had with other queers as well as what I've seen in
						other people.
					</div>
					<div>
						People aren't evil. I don't hold hate for anyone, reality already makes
						little enough sense that trying to apply some hate method to my black box
						would probably just be frustrating.
					</div>
					<div>
						Cis folx can be terrible. Those people still wholely inside get jealous
						easily, ingrained with archaic concepts of role fulfillment, blinded by
						blood and legacy. But they're not in control. They were write locked by
						capital automata and societal norm after getting their brains baked to be
						perfect little bricks in the wall.
					</div>
					<div>
						Trannies vary. I'm speaking on trans people my age or a bit below, older gen
						trans folx are another interesting topic that I don't have the brain power
						to get into right now. They'd probably fill out another bullet here, though.
						There's a gradient to this all too, My only goal is to mark vague traits and
						typical thoughts on a line from hinged to unhinged.
						<ul>
							<li>
								Queers and trannies who grew up with loving parents, in middle class
								households where their greatest hardship was getting misgendered in
								high school. They're pretty binary brained, pretty mono, pretty
								vanilla. These folx care too much about their labels, whether its
								mental illnesses or gender dichotomies or status. I've met some
								insufferable trans folx who grew up rich, who are completely
								integrated into their class culture and normative culture. These
								folx stress me out.
							</li>
							<li>
								Queers and trannies who went through a lot of shit. I think most
								trans folx I know grew up pretty fucked. Little to no solace found
								in the meatspace, usually relying on the wired to fill that space in
								the soul. Lots of mental fuckery, and outside societal norms for the
								most part. They're still hanging onto labels, the ones based in
								psychology. Neurodivergence, mental illnesses, mental disorders. I
								hold nothing but sympathy, but despise the filed of psychology as a
								whole. They can shed the labels. You don't need the capital
								automata's fleeting imposition of reality, you can create your own.
								Only some trannies that've gone through shit understand that.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div>
						I think I cling onto that concept of "hardship" a bit too much, because
						ultimately it's based on some standard for life "difficulty" that has some
						merit to it but is a bit oversimplistic. Humans all go through things
						that're difficult to them. Some humans go through things that stray from the
						universal greatly and end up making them way more tuned with the outside.
						The hardship shit also always comes off as a dick measuring contest too,
						which I detest.
					</div>
					<div>
						I was born with spina bifida. I'm permanently wheelchair bound. I grew up a
						nazi, whiplashed into a commie, and then settled into a paranoid anarchism.
						I have a hard time feeling like I have a self. My brain is plagued into a
						mindset entirely concerned with truth and power (ty foucault &lt;3). I've
						hurt people that care about me, and holy fuck I am so fucking sensitive to
						anything that comes off as manipulative. I went on a drug bender that landed
						me in the hospital for a month and blood thinners + compression socks for
						life after getting fucked with for months by people who I trusted with my
						life. My expected lifespan is somewhere in the 40s or earlier. I think it's
						fair to say I've gone through some shit, but again, no emphasis on a dick
						measuring contest.
					</div>
					<div>
						People infantilize me a lot since I'm a wheelchair fag, which is nice
						because I get away with a lot of shit. I'm not very intimidating, which
						helps me not get super stressed because people just tend to be trusting and
						I can be super forward as a result. I'm surprisingly mentally stable, and
						have a values system that denies me the timeline where I ever rope. Shits
						fucked but god do I love trying to make the most of it !!!
