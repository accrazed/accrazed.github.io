						I've been wanting to read more Mark Fisher, the little that I've read has tickled me in
						ways that I'm rather fond of. He talks about time, and I know time gets brought up a lot
						in the ("Post-left"? "schizoid left"? "CCRU-ey shit"??? I don't like words, you'll know
						what I mean of course :3) social circles and rivers of conscious I return to time and
						time again. I think about "memory" a lot too, with respect to Deleuze-Guattari's
						attribution of cruelty to the inscribing socius:
					</div>
					<div class="quote">
						It [culture] makes men or their organs into the parts and wheels of the social machine.
						The sign is a position of desire; but the first signs are the territorial signs that
						plant their flags in bodies. And if one wants to call this inscription in naked flesh
						"writing," then it must be said that speech in fact presupposes writing, and that it is
						this cruel system of inscribed signs that renders man capable of language, and gives him
						a memory of the spoken word.
						<div class="quote"><i>AO145:1</i></div>
					</div>
					<div>
						Time and Memory, these things occupy my space. There are little bugs (they look exactly
						like this -> <code>3(8)(8)[...](8):3</code>) that tell me that the flesh constantly
						retrospects, always presently looking into pasts to make decisions into futures. present
						pasts, presently past futures, presently past goods, presently past bads, presently past
						drones, cakes, money, shit, etc, and so on, and so forth, etc. Simple enough? There's
						probably a lot more that gets said on this. Is this The Eternal Return?(???)
					</div>
					<div>
						Memories lie in the domain of the production of recording, since it is only Experiences
						(allegedly) themselves that get the bite of cake, that are the first to fall back upon
						the body without organs. Your flesh may mnemotechnically call upon the experience again,
						and you get a second experience, copying the memory of the first—well,,,,, memory#2
						smells now, it's decayed, rotting....no, morphed, and places itself in the present
						again, for just a moment, folding unto itself. And if the flesh desires-remembering, it
						will find itself marking bodies of itself-as-kin. Explicit memories find themselves
						rememberable. Marks are not always explicit, I think they're habitual (as David Hume
						intended), and ingrain themselves in our social production like wives tens of thousands
						of years ago obfuscating their menstrual patterns in ways that empower themselves
						against coomer-brained husbands (desiring-sex), birthing healthier children with more
						grey matter (...and more memories, hell with it all). This is some stuff to do with a
						response to the initial zine that was talking about, critiquing it for trying to create
						mythos, and then in turn
						<a
							href="https://libcom.org/article/gender-egalitarianism-made-us-human-response-david-graeber-david-wengrows-how-change-course"
						>
							seemingly creating more mythos, this baking a naturalist feminism.

					</div>

					<div>
						In any case, you can ignore any implications of the words I say as a means to try to
						mark a beginning point to memory or fascism or eden-as-egalitarianism or whatever, I
						only really hope to dig into the process of remembering::explicit
						memories/forgetting::implicit memories, and why I don't like remembering the same things
						again and again. Forgive my vitalisms. Back to the implicit marks->

					<div class="quote">
						There are some secrets which do not permit themselves to be told. Men die nightly in
						their beds, wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them piteously in the
						eyes—die with despair of heart and convulsion of throat, on account of the hideousness
						of mysteries which will not suffer themselves to be revealed. Now and then, alas, the
						conscience of man takes up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only
						into the grave. And thus the essence of all crime is undivulged.
						<div class="quote"><i>The Man of the Crowd</i>, John Poe (maybe)</div>
					</div>

					<div>
						Habit, "coded flow", "implicit marks", "the subconscious", "untold secrets", a bit
						obscure but as it goes with words steered by things (◕‿◕✿). I found this text when
						cruising the wire for commentary on Grand Narratives, specifically invocations of
						psychoanalytic Great Men and Unruly Crowds, as described by DG when explaining the
						segregative uses of Oedipus, and the nauseating texts that follow Oedipus (around p102).
						John Poe I think tugs at this from a cute perspective, in this story wherein the Main
						Character's (<strong>key</strong>: subject's) observation of a supposed Great Man
						walking the streets of London leads him to follow, to learn his truths, his undivulged
						crimes.
					</div>

					<div>
						These secrets are at a glance very grounded in the MC's explicit framings. They read the
						countenances of those in the crowd constantly, create groupings, shared behaviors, whole
						stories, belongings (segregations), as intuitively as any glorious modernist should. But
						upon seeing the great man, MC finds him cryptic, MC finds a secret they cannot tell, and
						lo and behold, it's something that cannot be gathered in the explicit, in the conscious,
						in the subject.
					</div>

					<div>
						He follows The man, who spends all time following crowds, getting nervous upon finding
						himself alone on certain streets, tracing and retracing steps, until night falls and day
						breaks and he cycles once again.
					</div>

					<div class="quote">
						And, as the shades of the second evening came on, I grew wearied unto death, and,
						stopping fully in front of the wanderer, gazed at him steadfastly in the face. He
						noticed me not, but resumed his solemn walk, while I, ceasing to follow, remained
						absorbed in contemplation. "This old man," I said at length, "is the type and the genius
						of deep crime. He refuses to be alone. He is the man of the crowd. It will be in vain to
						follow; for I shall learn no more of him, nor of his deeds. The worst heart of the world
						is a grosser book than the 'Hortulus Animæ,' and perhaps it is but one of the great
						mercies of God that <i>'er lasst sich nicht lesen</i>"
						<div class="quote"><i>The Man of the Crowd</i>, John Poe (maybe)</div>
					</div>

					<br />
					<div>
						Is The Man just the crowd? Seemingly, but MC can't frame him, can't make sense of him.
						But where's the man then? If you were paying attention, these kinds of dualisms that let
						people dissociate themselves into crowds or men are nauseating psychoanalytic garbage to
						begin with. The Man's secret is one that cannot be told, because these secrets like many
						transcend the subject-object, and exist much beyond us.
					</div>

					<div>
						What's this got to do with memory (asking for a friend)? Well, if memories are
						"explicit" markings, then we can relate them to the "implicit" markings of habit as
						discernible secrets, and furthermore a truth of "real" secrets, secrets that do not
						permit themselves to be told. The "explicit"/"implicit" differentiation of secrets is
						strictly undecidable in the same way that the whole of Oedipus is strictly undecidable
						(src: trust me bro), and so in this case, remembering and forgetting are on the same
						side of the coin.
					</div>

					<div>
						Does the Man have memories? Explicit::Implicit? We can surely draw a pretty little story
						about the man's flesh, its movements like rhythms, divide its steps into BPMs, and make
						a cool Victorian jungle track out of it, but I mostly orbited this story as a means for
						drawing a few lines that would help me orient myself, and then moving on. I'll forget
						about this question just a bit later.
					</div>

					<div>
						What's on the other side of the coin? Well, real secrets that cannot be spoken.
						Desiring-Production, of course.
					</div>

					<div class="quote">
						And what is an authentic lunatic? He is a man who has preferred to become what is
						socially understood as mad rather than forfeit a certain superior idea of human honour.
						In its asylums, society has managed to strangle all those it has wished to rid itself of
						or to defend itself from, because they refused to make themselves accomplices to various
						flagrant dishonesties. For a lunatic is also a man whom society has not wished to listen
						to, and whom it is determined to prevent from uttering unbearable truths.

						Remembering is just like forgetting, especially when we can look forward or back in that
						boring in-between from one amnesia to another, and see smiley faces :3
					</div>

					<div>
						I think this helps reconcile my gripes with how much
						<code>Present Day, Present Time</code> is full of shit that makes us constantly
						oscillate between the two. Ames in 2025:
						<ul>
							<li>
								microplastics which help us forget easier, just so we can remember once again ^-^
							</li>
							<li>
								ad-revenue from children incentivizing content that appeals to everyone with money
								(including those who will have money, in teh futur ofc :3)
							</li>
							<li>
								ten billion stimulations that cause no extra brain wrinkles, keeping us smooth and
								epilated uwu

						I'm running out of memory for this so I'll leave with this song about dead
						nurturer-machines, and the suffering in trying to appropriate divine memory, in
						<code>Present Day, Present Time</code>. Don't get caught up remembering::forgetting when
						you still experience, lest your soul break like rocks to oars.

				<div class="thought-title">[1683833638]: "Bad" people two</div>
				<div class="thought-body">
					<div>
						My head is filled to the brim rent-free with reality deltas I perceive across different
						folks. It's pretty fucking gay. An ex of mine contacted me out of the blue disappointed
						that after 4 or 5 months since having spoken that I hadn't realized that they "weren't
						the bad guy in all of this." My close friend had her shit broken into and doesn't know
						who to trust anymore, because it very well could have been a fellow tran that did it.
						I've been told by close friends I love dearly not to interact with certain people
						because those friends were almost raped by them. I've even been accused of doing
						terrible awful things myself by people who'd walk back on it and be friendly with me
						months later. It's frankly frustrating, and obstructively so.
					</div>

					<div>Manipulation.</div>
					<div>
						There's a million and one words you could get spat out by the field of psychology to
						help explain this delta, but I despise the field as a whole and trying to read into
						humans to try and predict them is prone to misuse and exploitation, and I know too many
						people who use that shit to twist narratives and get friends to side with one person
						over the other. Under layers of obfuscation and prae-parared terminology, between webs
						of stretched half-truths and tactical appeals to "consent" and fairness - Extract from
						it all the "intent" and malicious acting, and just throw that shit away. People can do
						these things maliciously, but I'm sure that most people are hardly aware they're
						actually manipulating. Different value systems and frameworks of reality provide so many
						nooks and crannies for people with shitty behavior to crawl into, and it's just normal
						to them.
					</div>

					<div>
						Psychology lends itself very well to manipulative behavior, through a false appeal to a
						hard science that proves for sure that some behavior is a pattern, that people have
						mental illnesses that make them less valuable than another, that can overtly shield folx
						from criticism for fear of reviving trauma.
					</div>

					<div>
						All this to say, it's damn near fucking impossible to trust people. I remember when the
						world was small, and I trusted everyone at their word, and took their word as fact. But
						holy fucking shit, So many people refuse to talk clearly, to own up to realities, to
						show love for everyone. I get depressed thinking about it. I wish queers at least were
						better than this, but I end up feeling the opposite with so many queer folx with
						debilitating behaviors fueled from poor machinations of reality. My gut tells me queers
						are either staunchly naiive, or staunchly clear and considerate, or staunchly
						manipulative. This probably has correlations to those types of trannies I taked about
						during the first "Bad" people thing I wrote.
					</div>

					<div>Hence, the reality delta q.q</div>

					<div>Bad People.</div>

					<div>
						Now that our sense of truth in events among humans is utterly cum-fuzzled, that "Bad"
						people thing kinda gets fucked for it too. It's hard to tell what actually happened,
						hard to squeeze out tendencies or individual behaviors out of someone to reason about
						why a specific opportunity lent itself to that person doing a terrible act. What's
						created is this confusion slop (probably tastes like Huel) that's hard to escape.
					</div>

					<div>
						I don't really know how to deal with all that noise, and I'm frustrated about it. I
						think I just end up focusing instead of trying to help those close to me, loaded with
						paranoia and Foucaultian power dynamics, with efforts to minimize where I can and help
						people out regardless of the reality I view them in.
					</div>

					<div>
						I've given $16k to people who utterly wrecked havoc on my life because they were moving
						out of my apartment and I didn't want them to go homeless as much as they admitted to
						fucking with me emotionally and intentionally making strides to split me apart from
						people who were incredibly dear to me.
					</div>

					<div>
						I gave $3k to a person I only actually learned about that day because they needed money
						for an electric wheelchair, and I know how that is.
					</div>

					<div>
						I recently met some completely random people on Taimi who were apparently trying to
						escape from a really shitty home situation and now they're crashing in my apartment for
						the next couple months while they get footing.
					</div>

					<div>
						I help pay most the rent for someone who used to be homeless, and who I hardly ever see.
						They say they're saving up for college.
					</div>

					<div>
						When I leave this apartment for a new job I'm going to still be covering it because my
						wife and other queers can hardly hold jobs and can't cover rent on their own.
					</div>

					<div>
						I put thousands of dollars into queer folx's gofundmes, of whom I've been told have done
						shitty manipulative stuff, and who I should not interact with.
					</div>

					<div>
						But am I a good person? Fucking shrug. I focus more on whether people do good or bad
						actions, and have some universal value system that places strangers to the same degree
						of importance as close friends. Is it the truest sexiest moral system? Fucking shrug. I
						don't care, dilate about it. I think what's important though is just that I try to love
						all humans as much as I can, and I end up reducing my love only to queers but it's
						something I can handle at least.

						To call this a problem is incorrect - but it's floating around correctness. I never
						really understood what an addiction was before actually getting a drug addiction that's
						marked societally as one. It's hard to describe, but the one thought that permeates my
						mind most about them is the subversiveness. You never know you're addicted until you
						step back and see things at a distance. It's similar to finding out whether partners are
						manipulative - individual actions will never really show you much. Even then, its still
						difficult. Reality gives the impression that addictions are very discrete entities.
					</div>
					<div>
						You play Fallout, you do the drug-sounding drug, and after you take a specific amount
						you'll be notified that you're addicted to XYZ. After exactly VVV days, -5% Max health,
						-3% Movement speed, 5% less damage dealt. You know exactly what's going on, you get
						direct feedback on how you're "suffering", and there is no psychological desire present.
						In reality, you never see your life fall apart when you do drugs. Sometimes it doesn't
						even fall apart at all. But other times, you miss an assignment. You didn't maximize job
						finding because you spent 20 hours a week high and now money is getting tight. You just
						really need a cigarette. You're hanging out with folx who get you to try DXM, and now
						you just have another tool for fun to do at home, to relieve that stress, to feel nice.
					</div>
					<div>
						I don't want to demonize drugs, or even imply them as solely harmful. Ultimately, folx
						do what they want with the reality given, and given an incessant capital machine and
						little outs for enjoyment, it's pretty optimal to go to raves and bump ket. It's rough
						though, it's really rough.

						I've thought a lot about bad people, and I'm not so sure why but it doesn't really
						change a whole lot in my head when I do anymore. I think I just want to try and make
						something as vague and loaded as the concept of evil into something that makes sense,
						which is fruitless.
					</div>
					<div>
						Someone who I think has gone through a whole lot of shit in their life told me a while
						ago that 1/6 trannies are pretty vile people. Just awful, shitty, horrible people,
						usually showing itself in egotistical folks, rapey energy, lying and manipulation,
						etcetera. I didn't think hard about it for the longest time, but honestly at this point
						after having met so many folx and seeing how much suffering we cause each other I get
						where they're coming from.
					</div>
					<div>
						I'm scared of a lot of people. "Scared" isn't the right word either, it's more that I'm
						hesitant. I can hardly build any relationship with a cishet person because I've already
						blown out my interests and mannerisms to degrees that only queer folx can understand,
						and even then there's this extra layer of shit you need to sift through for me to feel
						comfortable being alone in a room with you. There's anxiety concentrate - and that 1/6
						number -- and those experiences I've had with other queers as well as what I've seen in
						other people.
					</div>
					<div>
						People aren't evil. I don't hold hate for anyone, reality already makes little enough
						sense that trying to apply some hate method to my black box would probably just be
						frustrating.
					</div>
					<div>
						Cis folx can be terrible. Those people still wholely inside get jealous easily,
						ingrained with archaic concepts of role fulfillment, blinded by blood and legacy. But
						they're not in control. They were write locked by capital automata and societal norm
						after getting their brains baked to be perfect little bricks in the wall.
					</div>
					<div>
						Trannies vary. I'm speaking on trans people my age or a bit below, older gen trans folx
						are another interesting topic that I don't have the brain power to get into right now.
						They'd probably fill out another bullet here, though. There's a gradient to this all
						too, My only goal is to mark vague traits and typical thoughts on a line from hinged to
						unhinged.
						<ul>
							<li>
								Queers and trannies who grew up with loving parents, in middle class households
								where their greatest hardship was getting misgendered in high school. They're pretty
								binary brained, pretty mono, pretty vanilla. These folx care too much about their
								labels, whether its mental illnesses or gender dichotomies or status. I've met some
								insufferable trans folx who grew up rich, who are completely integrated into their
								class culture and normative culture. These folx stress me out.
							</li>
							<li>
								Queers and trannies who went through a lot of shit. I think most trans folx I know
								grew up pretty fucked. Little to no solace found in the meatspace, usually relying
								on the wired to fill that space in the soul. Lots of mental fuckery, and outside
								societal norms for the most part. They're still hanging onto labels, the ones based
								in psychology. Neurodivergence, mental illnesses, mental disorders. I hold nothing
								but sympathy, but despise the filed of psychology as a whole. They can shed the
								labels. You don't need the capital automata's fleeting imposition of reality, you
								can create your own. Only some trannies that've gone through shit understand that.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div>
						I think I cling onto that concept of "hardship" a bit too much, because ultimately it's
						based on some standard for life "difficulty" that has some merit to it but is a bit
						oversimplistic. Humans all go through things that're difficult to them. Some humans go
						through things that stray from the universal greatly and end up making them way more
						tuned with the outside. The hardship shit also always comes off as a dick measuring
						contest too, which I detest.
					</div>
					<div>
						I was born with spina bifida. I'm permanently wheelchair bound. I grew up a nazi,
						whiplashed into a commie, and then settled into a paranoid anarchism. I have a hard time
						feeling like I have a self. My brain is plagued into a mindset entirely concerned with
						truth and power (ty foucault &lt;3). I've hurt people that care about me, and holy fuck
						I am so fucking sensitive to anything that comes off as manipulative. I went on a drug
						bender that landed me in the hospital for a month and blood thinners + compression socks
						for life after getting fucked with for months by people who I trusted with my life. My
						expected lifespan is somewhere in the 40s or earlier. I think it's fair to say I've gone
						through some shit, but again, no emphasis on a dick measuring contest.
					</div>
					<div>
						People infantilize me a lot since I'm a wheelchair fag, which is nice because I get away
						with a lot of shit. I'm not very intimidating, which helps me not get super stressed
						because people just tend to be trusting and I can be super forward as a result. I'm
						surprisingly mentally stable, and have a values system that denies me the timeline where
						I ever rope. Shits fucked but god do I love trying to make the most of it !!!
