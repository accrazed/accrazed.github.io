				<div class="thought-title">[1683833638]: "Bad" people two</div>
				<div class="thought-body">
					<div>
						My head is filled to the brim rent-free with reality deltas I perceive
						across different folks. It's pretty fucking gay. An ex of mine contacted me
						out of the blue disappointed that after 4 or 5 months since having spoken
						that I hadn't realized that they "weren't the bad guy in all of this." My
						close friend had her shit broken into and doesn't know who to trust anymore,
						because it very well could have been a fellow tran that did it. I've been
						told by close friends I love dearly not to interact with certain people
						because those friends were almost raped by them. I've even been accused of
						doing terrible awful things myself by people who'd walk back on it and be
						friendly with me months later. It's frankly frustrating, and obstructively
						so.
					</div>

					<div>Manipulation.</div>
					<div>
						There's a million and one words you could get spat out by the field of
						psychology to help explain this delta, but I despise the field as a whole
						and trying to read into humans to try and predict them is prone to misuse
						and exploitation, and I know too many people who use that shit to twist
						narratives and get friends to side with one person over the other. Under
						layers of obfuscation and prae-parared terminology, between webs of
						stretched half-truths and tactical appeals to "consent" and fairness -
						Extract from it all the "intent" and malicious acting, and just throw that
						shit away. People can do these things maliciously, but I'm sure that most
						people are hardly aware they're actually manipulating. Different value
						systems and frameworks of reality provide so many nooks and crannies for
						people with shitty behavior to crawl into, and it's just normal to them.
					</div>

					<div>
						Psychology lends itself very well to manipulative behavior, through a false
						appeal to a hard science that proves for sure that some behavior is a
						pattern, that people have mental illnesses that make them less valuable than
						another, that can overtly shield folx from criticism for fear of reviving
						trauma.
					</div>

					<div>
						All this to say, it's damn near fucking impossible to trust people. I
						remember when the world was small, and I trusted everyone at their word, and
						took their word as fact. But holy fucking shit, So many people refuse to
						talk clearly, to own up to realities, to show love for everyone. I get
						depressed thinking about it. I wish queers at least were better than this,
						but I end up feeling the opposite with so many queer folx with debilitating
						behaviors fueled from poor machinations of reality. My gut tells me queers
						are either staunchly naiive, or staunchly clear and considerate, or
						staunchly manipulative. This probably has correlations to those types of
						trannies I taked about during the first "Bad" people thing I wrote.
					</div>

					<div>Hence, the reality delta q.q</div>

					<div>Bad People.</div>

					<div>
						Now that our sense of truth in events among humans is utterly cum-fuzzled,
						that "Bad" people thing kinda gets fucked for it too. It's hard to tell what
						actually happened, hard to squeeze out tendencies or individual behaviors
						out of someone to reason about why a specific opportunity lent itself to
						that person doing a terrible act. What's created is this confusion slop
						(probably tastes like Huel) that's hard to escape.
					</div>

					<div>
						I don't really know how to deal with all that noise, and I'm frustrated
						about it. I think I just end up focusing instead of trying to help those
						close to me, loaded with paranoia and Foucaultian power dynamics, with
						efforts to minimize where I can and help people out regardless of the
						reality I view them in.
					</div>

					<div>
						I've given $16k to people who utterly wrecked havoc on my life because they
						were moving out of my apartment and I didn't want them to go homeless as
						much as they admitted to fucking with me emotionally and intentionally
						making strides to split me apart from people who were incredibly dear to me.
					</div>

					<div>
						I gave $3k to a person I only actually learned about that day because they
						needed money for an electric wheelchair, and I know how that is.
					</div>

					<div>
						I recently met some completely random people on Taimi who were apparently
						trying to escape from a really shitty home situation and now they're
						crashing in my apartment for the next couple months while they get footing.
					</div>

					<div>
						I help pay most the rent for someone who used to be homeless, and who I
						hardly ever see. They say they're saving up for college.
					</div>

					<div>
						When I leave this apartment for a new job I'm going to still be covering it
						because my wife and other queers can hardly hold jobs and can't cover rent
						on their own.
					</div>

					<div>
						I put thousands of dollars into queer folx's gofundmes, of whom I've been
						told have done shitty manipulative stuff, and who I should not interact
						with.
					</div>

					<div>
						But am I a good person? Fucking shrug. I focus more on whether people do
						good or bad actions, and have some universal value system that places
						strangers to the same degree of importance as close friends. Is it the
						truest sexiest moral system? Fucking shrug. I don't care, dilate about it. I
						think what's important though is just that I try to love all humans as much
						as I can, and I end up reducing my love only to queers but it's something I
						can handle at least.
					</div>

					<div>
						I end this long post as unsatisfied and confused as I was when I started.

						It really does feel like everyone has a drug problem these days, Schneeweis.
					</div>
					<br />
					<div>
						[REDACTED] is a ket addict, smoking weed every week and still buying packs
						of Newports and throwing them out after taking a couple. Money is tight, but
						that doesn't matter! Damaged goods!
					</div>
					<div>
						[REDACTED] is doing coke, ket, and weed. Pretty depressed, pretty empty.
						That feeling of the lack of control of the body is apparent.
					</div>
					<div>
						[REDACTED] is a lifelong opioid addict. Phenibut, Gabapentin, the works.
					</div>
					<div>
						[REDACTED] was overdosing outside the apartment off heroin or worse. Thank
						god for Narcan. Hell to Nitazines.
					</div>
					<div>
						[REDACTED] really likes speed, has an ADHD prescription coincidentally.
						Wants meth, takes drugs for the fun of it.
					</div>
					<div>
						[REDACTED] takes ket to forget about the gnawing disconnection with anyone
						around.
					</div>
					<div>
						[REDACTED] has an apartment littered with whippits. Weed is everyday, every
						time.
					</div>
					<div>
						[REDACTED] smokes Marlboro reds (gross), sniffs poppers, and hopes to drug
						themselves to the point of vegetation.
					</div>
					<div>
						[REDACTED] used to do so much DXM, and now focuses on ket. Brain fried. DXM
						is the devil.
					</div>
					<div>
						[REDACTED]'s brain broke after enough DXM. Hatred of those once close,
						paranoia. DXM is the devil.
					</div>
					<div>[REDACTED] likes speed. Smokes too.</div>
					<div>
						[REDACTED] can't do molly or acid anymore. The presence of Xanax causes
						anxiety, Ketamine causes want. Former smoker.
					</div>
					<div>[REDACTED] is never not on acid. Raves for molly and ket.</div>
					<div>[REDACTED] feels safe when on ket.</div>
					<br />
					<div>
						To call this a problem is incorrect - but it's floating around correctness.
						I never really understood what an addiction was before actually getting a
						drug addiction that's marked societally as one. It's hard to describe, but
						the one thought that permeates my mind most about them is the
						subversiveness. You never know you're addicted until you step back and see
						things at a distance. It's similar to finding out whether partners are
						manipulative - individual actions will never really show you much. Even
						then, its still difficult. Reality gives the impression that addictions are
						very discrete entities.
					</div>
					<div>
						You play Fallout, you do the drug-sounding drug, and after you take a
						specific amount you'll be notified that you're addicted to XYZ. After
						exactly VVV days, -5% Max health, -3% Movement speed, 5% less damage dealt.
						You know exactly what's going on, you get direct feedback on how you're
						"suffering", and there is no psychological desire present. In reality, you
						never see your life fall apart when you do drugs. Sometimes it doesn't even
						fall apart at all. But other times, you miss an assignment. You didn't
						maximize job finding because you spent 20 hours a week high and now money is
						getting tight. You just really need a cigarette. You're hanging out with
						folx who get you to try DXM, and now you just have another tool for fun to
						do at home, to relieve that stress, to feel nice.
					</div>
					<div>
						I don't want to demonize drugs, or even imply them as solely harmful.
						Ultimately, folx do what they want with the reality given, and given an
						incessant capital machine and little outs for enjoyment, it's pretty optimal
						to go to raves and bump ket. It's rough though, it's really rough.
					</div>
					<div>
						Drugs make me sad. They make me think of the community of people that I
						relate to at the root, the people I'll try to protect to my last breath, and
						I get sad. I get really sad.

						I'm pretty stressed out. It's manageable, it always is, kinda. Managability
						makes sense, though whether something is manageable makes less sense. I've
						been reading Anti-Oedipus and I'll be able to make connections between it
						and managability through some kind of weird desiring-machine (or whatever
						the fuck. I'm only on chapter 2 and I'm reading slow, be nice). The capital
						machine produces working-stress machine produces overwhelming-amy machines
						produces amy-willpower. (not very good at this (u cud say a minor-product of
						these machines is brainfuzz-stupid.bitch.energy machines))

					<div>Interview grind is gay. Techies suffer for it (not a bad thing).</div>
					<div>
						I'm tired. I'm so tired. Those desires to just be taken care of by a tech
						tran who can keep me safe is a trap. Never ever fall for this. More will to
						power is needed and those desires reduce productivity of will-powers.
						Comfort produced by the weight of the eyes - ecstasy in the soreness of the
						spine - love-drunk happiness when fingers stiff and concentration is short.

						I want to write more on the "Bad people" thing,I spoke with a close friend
						Izz about it and I think there's a lot to it. Off the top of my head, I
						don't think people are just "rapists", its more just that they have "rapey"
						behaviors that can fly under the radar most the time but once in a blue
						moon, when everything lines up, that "rapey" behavior causes a lot of harm
						to someone. I was thinking this when thinking about a few times when I was
						going to interact with someone I didn't know very well and a close friend
						would tell me that they did terrible terrible things. When I actually end up
						hanging out with them, nothing bad happens, or alternatively when talking to
						them about the situation their reality is incredibly different.
					</div>
					<div>
						I'll probably get to writing more about it so I can organize my thoughts
						better.

						I've thought a lot about bad people, and I'm not so sure why but it doesn't
						really change a whole lot in my head when I do anymore. I think I just want
						to try and make something as vague and loaded as the concept of evil into
						something that makes sense, which is fruitless.
					</div>
					<div>
						Someone who I think has gone through a whole lot of shit in their life told
						me a while ago that 1/6 trannies are pretty vile people. Just awful, shitty,
						horrible people, usually showing itself in egotistical folks, rapey energy,
						lying and manipulation, etcetera. I didn't think hard about it for the
						longest time, but honestly at this point after having met so many folx and
						seeing how much suffering we cause each other I get where they're coming
						from.
					</div>
					<div>
						I'm scared of a lot of people. "Scared" isn't the right word either, it's
						more that I'm hesitant. I can hardly build any relationship with a cishet
						person because I've already blown out my interests and mannerisms to degrees
						that only queer folx can understand, and even then there's this extra layer
						of shit you need to sift through for me to feel comfortable being alone in a
						room with you. There's anxiety concentrate - and that 1/6 number -- and
						those experiences I've had with other queers as well as what I've seen in
						other people.
					</div>
					<div>
						People aren't evil. I don't hold hate for anyone, reality already makes
						little enough sense that trying to apply some hate method to my black box
						would probably just be frustrating.
					</div>
					<div>
						Cis folx can be terrible. Those people still wholely inside get jealous
						easily, ingrained with archaic concepts of role fulfillment, blinded by
						blood and legacy. But they're not in control. They were write locked by
						capital automata and societal norm after getting their brains baked to be
						perfect little bricks in the wall.
					</div>
					<div>
						Trannies vary. I'm speaking on trans people my age or a bit below, older gen
						trans folx are another interesting topic that I don't have the brain power
						to get into right now. They'd probably fill out another bullet here, though.
						There's a gradient to this all too, My only goal is to mark vague traits and
						typical thoughts on a line from hinged to unhinged.
						<ul>
							<li>
								Queers and trannies who grew up with loving parents, in middle class
								households where their greatest hardship was getting misgendered in
								high school. They're pretty binary brained, pretty mono, pretty
								vanilla. These folx care too much about their labels, whether its
								mental illnesses or gender dichotomies or status. I've met some
								insufferable trans folx who grew up rich, who are completely
								integrated into their class culture and normative culture. These
								folx stress me out.
							</li>
							<li>
								Queers and trannies who went through a lot of shit. I think most
								trans folx I know grew up pretty fucked. Little to no solace found
								in the meatspace, usually relying on the wired to fill that space in
								the soul. Lots of mental fuckery, and outside societal norms for the
								most part. They're still hanging onto labels, the ones based in
								psychology. Neurodivergence, mental illnesses, mental disorders. I
								hold nothing but sympathy, but despise the filed of psychology as a
								whole. They can shed the labels. You don't need the capital
								automata's fleeting imposition of reality, you can create your own.
								Only some trannies that've gone through shit understand that.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div>
						I think I cling onto that concept of "hardship" a bit too much, because
						ultimately it's based on some standard for life "difficulty" that has some
						merit to it but is a bit oversimplistic. Humans all go through things
						that're difficult to them. Some humans go through things that stray from the
						universal greatly and end up making them way more tuned with the outside.
						The hardship shit also always comes off as a dick measuring contest too,
						which I detest.
					</div>
					<div>
						I was born with spina bifida. I'm permanently wheelchair bound. I grew up a
						nazi, whiplashed into a commie, and then settled into a paranoid anarchism.
						I have a hard time feeling like I have a self. My brain is plagued into a
						mindset entirely concerned with truth and power (ty foucault &lt;3). I've
						hurt people that care about me, and holy fuck I am so fucking sensitive to
						anything that comes off as manipulative. I went on a drug bender that landed
						me in the hospital for a month and blood thinners + compression socks for
						life after getting fucked with for months by people who I trusted with my
						life. My expected lifespan is somewhere in the 40s or earlier. I think it's
						fair to say I've gone through some shit, but again, no emphasis on a dick
						measuring contest.
					</div>
					<div>
						People infantilize me a lot since I'm a wheelchair fag, which is nice
						because I get away with a lot of shit. I'm not very intimidating, which
						helps me not get super stressed because people just tend to be trusting and
						I can be super forward as a result. I'm surprisingly mentally stable, and
						have a values system that denies me the timeline where I ever rope. Shits
						fucked but god do I love trying to make the most of it !!!
